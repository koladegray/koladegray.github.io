    "text": "First, a bit of background on the paper and the idea of hypothesizing that a variable “has no effect.”\nI remember sitting in a talk as a first-year graduate student, and the speaker said something like: “I expect no effect here, and, just as I expected, the difference is not statistically significant.” I was a little bit taken aback—of course, that’s not a compelling argument for a null effect. But I saw this approach taken again and again in published work.\nMy first publication was an AJPS article (Rainey 2014) explaining why this doesn’t work well and how to do it better.\nHere’s what I wrote in that paper:\n\nHypothesis testing is a powerful empirical argument not because it shows that the data are consistent with the research hypothesis, but because it shows that the data are inconsistent with other hypotheses (i.e., the null hypothesis). However, researchers sometimes reverse this logic when arguing for a negligible effect, showing only that the data are consistent with “no effect” and failing to show that the data are inconsistent with meaningful effects. When researchers argue that a variable has “no effect” because its confidence interval contains zero, they take no steps to rule out large, meaningful effects, making the empirical claim considerably less persuasive (Altman and Bland 1995; Gill 1999; Nickerson 2000).\n\nBut here’s a critical point, it’s impossible to reject every hypothesis except exactly no effect. Instead, the researcher must define a range of substantively “negligible” effects. The researcher can reject the null hypothesis that the effect falls outside this range of negligible effects. However, this requires a substantive judgement about those effects that are negligible and those that are not.\nHere’s what I wrote:\n\nResearchers who wish to argue for a negligible effect must precisely define the set of effects that are deemed “negligible” as well as the set of effects that are “meaningful.” This requires defining the smallest substantively meaningful effect, which I denote as \\(m\\). The definition must be debated by substantive scholars for any given context because the appropriate \\(m\\) varies widely across applications."

    "text": "Clark and Golder (2006)\nClark and Golder (2006) offer a nice example of this sort of hypothesis. I’ll refer you there and to Rainey (2014) for a complete discussion of their idea, but I’ll motivate it briefly here.\nExplaining why a country might have only a few (i.e., two) parties, Clark and Golder write:\n\nFirst, it could be the case that the demand for parties is low because there are few social cleavages. In this situation, there would be few parties whether the electoral institutions were permissive or not. Second, it could be the case that the electoral system is not permissive. In this situation, there would be a small number of parties even if the demand for political parties were high. Only a polity characterized by both a high degree of social heterogeneity and a highly permissive electoral system is expected to produce a large number of parties. (p. 683)\n\nThus, they expect that electoral institutions won’t matter in socially homogenous systems. And they expect that social heterogeneity won’t matter in electoral systems that are not permissive."
