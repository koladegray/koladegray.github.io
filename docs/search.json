I’ll refer you there and to Rainey (2014) for a complete discussion of their idea, but I’ll motivate it briefly here.\nExplaining why a country might have only a few (i.e., two) parties, Clark and Golder write:\n\nFirst, it could be the case that the demand for parties is low because there are few social cleavages. In this situation, there would be few parties whether the electoral institutions were permissive or not. Second, it could be the case that the electoral system is not permissive. In this situation, there would be a small number of parties even if the demand for political parties were high. Only a polity characterized by both a high degree of social heterogeneity and a highly permissive electoral system is expected to produce a large number of parties. (p. 683)\n\nThus, they expect that electoral institutions won’t matter in socially homogenous systems. And they expect that social heterogeneity won’t matter in electoral systems that are not permissive."

Minoxidil, UVA therapy, and the experimental use of immunosuppressive drugs are common management options.\n\nAndrogenic Alopecia\n\nAlso described as ‘Patterned Hair Loss’, androgenic hair loss is considered the most commonly reported form of alopecia in both men and women. Data review from early studies published by the Southern Medical Journal and Dermatologic Surgery suggests that about half of androgenic alopecia male patients were diagnosed by age 50. Whereas, about 40% of androgenic alopecia female patients were diagnosed by age 70. In men, it is presented as a receding frontline with biphasic hair loss and shaft thinning. The presentation in women is slightly different with shaft thinning observed only at the crown as the anterior hairline remains preserved.

    "section": "Pathophysiology of Androgenic Alopecia",
    "text": "Pathophysiology of Androgenic Alopecia\nAndrogenic alopecia is perhaps the most discussed alopecia form in the medical world. Many studies and clinical surveys have been conducted to understand its etiologies and disease course. Globally, there is a race distribution pattern on the incidence of androgenic alopecia. It is commonly diagnosed in the White population, followed by the Asian, African Americans, Native Americans, and Eskimos.\nIn a normal hair growth cycle, activation of the androgen receptors shortens the growth phase of each hair strand. Factors that directly modify the activation ate of this process present an overbearing effect on hair development. In androgenic alopecia, the activation trigger is excessively presented, leading to follicular miniaturization as the growth phase significantly shortens. Hair shafts produced becomes thin, short, and weakly penetrate through the epidermis. In this form, the strands are shed off easily. Hair loss occurs bi-temporarily, starting at the anterior hairline progressively moves over the scalp. At the vertex scalp, hair loss begins centrally and radiates outwards in all directions. Although hair loss is patterned, the site of hair loss is affected differently. In some men, balding is more prominent at the front, and in others, at the crown.\n\nConventional Therapy Methods\nConventionally, many forms of alopecia are treated with the same therapy protocol. In androgenic alopecia, management plans are directed at combatting the excessive activation of the androgenic receptors. This attempt to normalize the length of the growth phase requires extensive clinical monitoring, and many times a multi-therapy approach. The conventional therapy currently available struggles to directly reduce the rate of follicular miniaturization and promote hair replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescription Data\n\n\n\nCurrent trends in prescription data suggests that the FDA-approved drugs, topical Minoxidil and Finasteride are the most prescribed medications for androgenic alopecia.\n\n\nTopical minoxidil is presented in different dosage strengths and is available over-the-counter. This option requires a 4 to 6-month blind administration before an improvement is expected. As the period elapses, a comprehensive clinical review is conducted to determine modifications. Patients struggle with adherence and many times, this leads to therapy failure. Many research studies suggest the use of high-strength topical minoxidil formulation on a short therapy course.\nMinoxidil, as a potassium channel blocker improves blood vessel dilation. This action triggers the circulation of more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the hair follicles. A rich supply of these components reportedly promotes the anagen phase and corrects alopecia in all its forms. Finasteride is another medication conventionally used in alopecia therapy regimens. It is commonly prescribed as a 1 mg daily regimen. As a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, this drug has shown significant efficacy in improving hair growth at the vertex. In female alopecia patients, finasteride has however shown inconsistent results. This, in parts, explains why it is considered contraindicated in females.\nOther drugs used in the off-label management of alopecia forms include Dutasteride, Cyproterone, and oral antiandrogens including spironolactone, prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost. Surgical options including hair transplant and laser treatment. These non-drug therapy options are also considered effective. Many patients opt for these as they are short-course therapies and are cosmetically satisfactory."

    "text": "Considering HOBRASIO as a Novel Integrative Therapy Option\nCurrently, the therapy options available for the management of alopecia forms produce inconsistent results. To a large part, the long-course drug therapies do not guarantee recovery, as their results cannot be easily reproductive in a patient population. Novel management methods using combination therapy options are quickly gaining traction in the medical community. These methods involve the combination of proven conventional and new therapies to rapidly improve hair growth or slow down hair loss. In addition to their effectiveness, these methods have shown considerable advantages in safety, skin compatibility, and result consistency.\nThe Hybrid Object Rejuvenation (HOBRASIO) option provides an evidence-based therapy for alopecia forms by combining different rejuvenation methods. This innovation improves hair growth in both gender and poses no medical threat to the patients. Although this method is new, there exists much research backing its usefulness in modern cosmetology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a 2016 review published by the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy, researchers recommended the use of combined therapy options in a same-day management model. Studies like this explore the possibilities and provide scientific backing for novel dermatology treatments like HOBRASIO\n\n\nIn the management of alopecia forms, HOBRASIO combines several proven strategies in a single therapy regimen. This innovation secures optimal therapy effects for epidermal rejuvenation. In addition to its regenerative effect on follicles, this novel therapy option also provides soft tissue augmentation and skin rejuvenation effects. Unlike in conventional management with fixed therapy modalities for alopecia, HOBRASIO combines different options within the limits of safety, for different skin types. This single approach makes it effective in promoting hair replacement at the vertex or the scalp. Patients are guaranteed a consistent result with a short-course therapy and no adherence problems."

    "text": "Hobrasio Regimen For Alopecia Forms\nAs a hybrid cosmetic therapy approach, HOBRASIO explores the combination of Minoxidil, low laser therapy, and Micro-needling for epidermal and superficial dermal problems. Alopecia falls right into this category. A combination of these three therapies into a single regimen triggers physiological modifications that solve alopecia. Combining these invasive procedures produces a desired clinical outcome that is considered cosmetically satisfactory. Early initiation of treatment can also effectively stop the transition to ‘alopecia universalis’ or ‘alopecia totalis.’\n\nMicro-needling\n\nMicro-needling is a relatively new therapy option in modern cosmetology. However, since its introduction in the early 90s, micro-needling has been used for different dermatological problems including skin rejuvenation, acne scarring, melisma, and surgical scar repair. This minimally invasive procedure involves the use of multiple fine needles to create micro-punctures in the skin. This action triggers a physiologic cascade that triggers vascularization and the release of growth factors.\nThese growth factors initiate the rapid formation of collagen and elastin. In its use for alopecia, micro-needling triggers the release of platelet-derived growth factors and epidermal factors that activate the hair bulge. Proteins releases in this cascade also stimulate dermal stems cells and subsequent hair formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a 2014 case study published by the Journal of Cutaneous and Anesthetic Surgery, a group of researchers demonstrated how micro-needling can effectively treat alopecia forms.\n\n\n\nLow Laser Therapy\n\nLow laser therapy is an innovative approach in modern dermatology that explores the physics of photons (particles of Light) for epidermal rejuvenation. Generally, this option utilizes low-intensity light at the red or near-infrared wavelength to alter the physiology of the epidermal cells. In a large part, the precise mechanism of action of low laser therapy in hair replacement has not yet been established. However, multiple research studies suggest that low laser stimulates the anagen re-entry of telogen hair follicles.\nBy modifying the normal cycle of hair growth, the low laser stimulates the increase in hair growth rate, hair density, and diameter. Hair shedding decreases and the primary symptoms of alopecia clinically resolve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the FDA approved the first Low laser device for use as a safe option for the treatment of alopecia. Since then, clinicians have increasingly recommended low laser therapy for many alopecia patients\n\n\n\nMinoxidil\n\nMinoxidil was originally developed as an anti-hypertensive. Post-market surveillance data suggested that this drug triggers hypertrichosis –excessive hair growth. Subsequently, topical formulations of minoxidil were developed and re-introduced for the treatment of alopecia. For several decades, minoxidil topical formulations have served primary purposes in hair growth therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinicians Should Note\n\n\n\nDespite its wide application today, the exact mechanism of action of minoxidil for hair regeneration remain unestablished\n\n\nResearch studies have however postulated different hypotheses for this action. Minoxidil plays a key role in cell proliferation at the early stages.\nMinoxidil sulfate, a metabolite of minoxidil has also been proposed to be involved in the hair rejuvenation effects of minoxidil. Minoxidil also stimulates prostaglandin E production in a cascade of reactions that ends with the stimulation of the hair follicles. This triggers the continuous growth of hair as the growth stage becomes elongated. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted to prove the efficacy of minoxidil at different concentrations for the treatment of androgenic alopecia."

    "text": "Popular Methods of Isolating Single Cells\nThe scientific race to isolate single cell from a whole genome started properly in 2009. Based on available evidence and the increasing need for cell-based studies in microbiology, scientists were able to analyze transcriptome complexity in individual cells using the first cell whole transcriptome sequencing protocol.\nThe scientific race to isolate single cell from a whole genome started properly in 2009. Based on available evidence and the increasing need for cell-based studies in microbiology, scientists were able to analyze transcriptome complexity in individual cells using the first cell whole transcriptome sequencing protocol.\nTwo years later, the science evolved and single-cell whole-genome sequencing was created. This breakthrough ushered in a new wave of scientific inquiries that led to the development of a single cell whole exome sequencing in 2012, and in 2013, a novel method of single cell epigenomic sequencing was developed.\nAs expected, the methods to isolating single cell from a whole genome were formed around these protocols. Currently, there are a few methods employed by different leading research institutions around the world in isolating single cells from cell culture or tissue mass. These methods, although effective to an extent, were with many shortcomings.\nTo a large extent, the general challenge associated with these old methods is in adequately controlling the quality and quantity of cell isolates extracted from tissues or cell cultures. These old methods include: \n\nFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\nMicrofluidics\nMechanical Micromanipulation\n\n\n\n1. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\n\nWith wide application in microbiology, immunology, and embryonic development, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting is widely used in many laboratories and genomic research facilities. A popular high point linked with FACS is the ease and efficiency with which this method can isolate multiple cells (hundreds of thousands of cells) in split timing.\n\n\n\n\nFACS\n\n\n\nThe protocol of operation of cell isolation in FACS is centered on\n\nCell size\nCell Fluorescence Properties\nCell Granularity\n\nThis method is generally considered efficient and fast as it creates a unique system of cell sorting. When in use, FACS can easily isolate designated cells from a tissue sample or genome by exploring the ability of these cells to fluorescence when pre-labeled.\nThis unique property of the FACS cell-sorting protocol explains its popularity in the study f single viral particles in a poll or assemblage of mixed viral genome. When compared with recently developed protocols, such as the Direct Library Preparation Plus, the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting method is limited in application.\nIn this method, it is compulsory that a bulk of the cell assemblage be prepared as sorting material and samples must be prepared in solution. Earlier observation reports also holds that the fluorescent dye used in cell labeling can damage the viability of cells or influence the inherent properties of the single cells.\n\n\n2. Microfluids\nThe shortcomings with FACS, especially the need for an abundant cell assemblage and risk of losing cell viability, led to the development of Microfluidics. This method employs a protocol setting completely different in mechanism to the FACS.\nMicrofluidics is widely used in\n\nMicrobiology\nEmbryonic development studies\nNeurobiology\n\nBasically, the Microfluidics setup uses a highly integrated system to achieve single cell culture and sequencing by manipulating small volumes of a few hundreds of micro-liters of fluids. As the nomenclature suggests, Microfluidics needs only a few volume of fluids in cell-based studies.\n\n\n\n\nMicrofluidics Setup\n\n\n\nResearch institutes from around the world are currently experimenting with the feasibility of employing Microfluidics in human medicine especially in the areas of epigenomics sequencing and single cell whole-genome studies.\nIn the laboratories and microbiological studies, Microfluidics can effectively separate biological nanoparticles from tissues samples, cell cultures and cell assemblage. In a 2016 publication of Nature, the future of Microfluidics was examined based on coverage and advantage in cell sequencing.\nReports from this review suggest that Microfluidics produces accurate results with a unique level of sensitivity in almost all research applications as reported. This method can also finely resolve nanoliter-to-picoliter volumes of samples in research studies that need timely analysis and effective outcomes in low volume fluids.\n\n\n3. Mechanical Micromanipulation\nAs an old and classic method in cell isolation and single-cell based studies, Mechanical Micromanipulation surely deserves an honorable mention. This manual method is cost-efficient and can only need cheap instrumentation especially when results are not needed to be extremely accurate.\nThis explains the continued use of Mechanical Micromanipulation in many Microbiology research laboratories around the world, despite the popularity of new methods. The Mechanical Micromanipulation setup only requires the mechanical suctioning of a single cell from a cell assemblage using a capillary pipette, microscope and other supporting instruments.\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Manipulation setup\n\n\n\nCell isolation is not automatic and as such requires personnel guidance in the visual inspection of single-cell color features and morphological characteristics. The shortcoming of Mechanical Micromanipulation is centered on its manual processes.\nRanging from personnel faults, to mechanical shearing during manipulation and the possibility of cell damage, the shortcoming of Mechanical Micromanipulation appears to be unlimited in perspective.\nAlthough, the microscope provides a means of exact cell identification in a tissue sample, an unskilled personnel might misidentify the target cell and the whole process is time-consuming. These shortcoming are solved in Microfluidics and the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting method"

    "text": "Direct Library Preparation Method: The Latest Innovation in Cell Sequencing\nThe Direct Library Preparation method of cell sequencing was developed as a scalable single-cell whole-genome sequencing platform. Compared to other methods before this innovation, the Direct Library Preparation instrumentation is perfectly designed for accuracy, high resolution and unparalleled efficiency in cell isolation experiments and research findings.\nRecently published biotech reviews on this subject matter have positioned DLP as more than just an innovation in cell isolation studies. By large, it ushers in an era where microbiology and human medicine can optimally benefit from technology.\n\n\n\n\nDLP\n\n\n\nThe instrumentation boasts of open source computational methods, image-based object recognition and commodity instrument. This innovation is widely used in many research finding for the identification of clonal populations and their corresponding genomic features.\nDirect Library Preparation has shown useful prospects in\n\nTumor studies\nMicrobiology\nNeurology\nImmunology\nEmbryonic development studies\n\nBy extension, there are theoretical evidences supporting the use of this novel method in genome heterogeneity studies, mutational processes and findings on clonal evolution in healthy and cancer tissues. Early reviews and studies on the Direct Library Preparation platform showed that it can capture a high-resolution microscopy images of cells. These images are captured as the cells navigates a transparent nozzle as they settle in wells.\nImage output allows for exact cell identification and separation. All single cell captures are lysed processes to produce unique sequencing inserts. Standard illumina protocols and allows the researcher to pool and sequence indexed libraries at the desired coverage depth.\nThe wide application of Direct Library Preparation in the research might also be linked with the innovative advantage of the development and inclusion of an open-source, cloud compatible software infrastructure. This inclusion allows the bulk storage of data and metadata produced in all sequencing and imaging processes. Based on a researcher’s preference, the result generated from this storage can be loaded into selected data visualization and assessment platform for further studies, data exploration and quality control.\nAn early report on the application of Direct Library Preparation was published by a January 2020 issue of Nature Methods. The authors in this study use Direct Library Preparation to generate a resource of 51,926 single-cell genomes and matched cell images from diverse cell types including cell lines, xenograft and diagnostic samples with limited material. The resource bulk generated allows the study of variations in mitotic mis-segregation rates across tissues types and genotypes. As expected, the analysis of genomic matches obtained and images captured aided in establishing a correlation between cellular morphology and genome ploidy states.\nThis single review on DLP argued a case for its integration into medical sciences especially in tumor and embryonic development studies. This study, as reported, also documented the calculation of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inferences of clonal phylogenies using aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles. As a last result in this study, the authors also reported clone-specific chromosomal aneuploidy in polyclonal populations as defined by joint analysis of the listed features. Speculations on the readiness of DLP’s use in human medicine are currently on debate.\nHowever, there are enough evidence to argue for its usefulness in tumor studies. By allowing the measurement of clonal replication states and rare aneuploidy patterns of single cells, DLP is evidently suitable for embryonic development and tumor tracking studies.\n\nComparison, Benefits and Features\nMicrofluidics, Mechanical Micromanipulation and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting are methods developed early in cell isolation and single cell studies. However, the shortcoming of these methods have called for their replacement in many research studies and laboratory institutes.\nThe biggest challenge posed by these methods is that samples must be prepared in suspension and thus, the spatial location of the target cells in the tissues or cell cultures can be lost easily. Surprisingly, the Direct Library Preparation protocol is affordable and can be widely used on scalable methods in human and cellular studies.\nThis method is also widely considered a low bias method that can allow the spontaneous and in-depth analysis of variety of samples. In essence, this method can be effectively employed in genomic matching of tissues, cell assemblage and cell cultures.\n\n\nHow Direct Library Preparation Solves the Problems in Cell Sequencing\nUnlike other methods, the Direct Library Preparation method also allows the determination of copy number variations (CNV), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), phylogenic reconstructions and cluster analyses.\nThe arrays of benefits of using the DLP in research and experimental findings are limitless and include:\n\nLow reagent cost\nHigh quality of singe cell whole genome libraries\nLineage reconstructions\nUse in the analysis of any cell and nuclei from 5 to 80 micrometer.\n\nTo a large extent, DLP solved the myriads of shortcomings associated with the early methods employed in cell sequencing researches. Using the Direct Library Preparation (DLP) method in single-cell whole-genome sequencing of clinical sample is currently considered one of the best approach for cell isolation in modern biotechnology.\nThis is coming at a time when Direct Library Preparation in human medicine is increasingly becoming a topic of global scientific interest. With time, more adoption of Direct Library Preparation method is expected to be recorded in many research facilities around the world.\nStill Testing"
