I’ll refer you there and to Rainey (2014) for a complete discussion of their idea, but I’ll motivate it briefly here.\nExplaining why a country might have only a few (i.e., two) parties, Clark and Golder write:\n\nFirst, it could be the case that the demand for parties is low because there are few social cleavages. In this situation, there would be few parties whether the electoral institutions were permissive or not. Second, it could be the case that the electoral system is not permissive. In this situation, there would be a small number of parties even if the demand for political parties were high. Only a polity characterized by both a high degree of social heterogeneity and a highly permissive electoral system is expected to produce a large number of parties. (p. 683)\n\nThus, they expect that electoral institutions won’t matter in socially homogenous systems. And they expect that social heterogeneity won’t matter in electoral systems that are not permissive."

Clinically, this condition is reviewed, diagnosed, and treated as ‘Alopecia.’ In many regions of the globe, alopecia is a common primary health complaint, constituting a huge portion of telemedicine services and point-of-care therapies. The pattern of hair loss in the population depends on different variables including genetic pool, healthcare efficiency index, common comorbidities, and multiple environmental triggers (Goldberg 2023). The psychosocial complications arising from this condition makes prompt diagnosis and management important determinant of prognosis.\n\n\n\nAlopecia Areata\n\nThis non-scaring form of hair loss is commonly described as Circular Hair Loss. Although it rarely occurs in clustered populations, it is considered the second most popular form of alopecia. Approximately, the lifetime prevalence of alopecia areata is pegged at 2% with an almost equal incidence on both men and women. Diagnosis for this form of alopecia is common before age 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nResearch studies have confirmed multiple etiologies for alopecia areata, with the most published studies concluding on the possibility of a hereditary component. People most commonly diagnosed with alopecia areata were likely to have a few comorbidities including thyroidal dysfunctions, autoimmune conditions, atopy, and vitiligo (Mysore, Chandrashekar, and Yepuri 2014).\n\n\nAlopecia areata presents as smooth, round patches with complete loss of hair and a retained follicular opening on the scalp and beard regions. Right on the edges of the affected region, short fragmented hair with thin shafts develops in isolated forms. Therapy delay may trigger a quick transition to ‘alopecia totalis’ –complete scalp balding or ‘alopecia universalis’ –hair loss on the body surface. The commonly adopted therapy protocols for alopecia areata involve a holistic modulation of the identified triggered for hair loss. Minoxidil, UVA therapy, and the experimental use of immunosuppressive drugs are common management options.\n\nAndrogenic Alopecia\n\nAlso described as ‘Patterned Hair Loss’, androgenic hair loss is considered the most commonly reported form of alopecia in both men and women. Data review from early studies published by the Southern Medical Journal and Dermatologic Surgery suggests that about half of androgenic alopecia male patients were diagnosed by age 50. Whereas, about 40% of androgenic alopecia female patients were diagnosed by age 70. In men, it is presented as a receding frontline with biphasic hair loss and shaft thinning. The presentation in women is slightly different with shaft thinning observed only at the crown as the anterior hairline remains preserved [(Qi and Garza 2014; Strazzulla et al. 2018)]. In many diagnosed cases, symptoms first occur at puberty ad progress slowly until the hair loss pattern becomes noticeable.\nA diagnosis for androgenic alopecia includes a review of clinical history, family history, and pattern of symptom presentation. Many times, androgenic alopecia transitions into complete baldness in men, however, this transition is rare in female patients. Adopted therapy protocols for this condition include the recent, FDA-approved medication, Minoxidil, commercially retailed as Rogaine. Other medications including Finasteride are considered as off-label therapy options for androgenic alopecia.\n\nDiffuse Alopecia Forms\n\nUnlike the forms of alopecia mentioned already, this group of alopecia forms affects the scalp uniformly. In acute telogen effluvium, hair loss can persist for about 6 months, with shedding triggers expressed 2-4 months earlier. Diffuse alopecia forms are of multiple etiologies. The most common etiologies linked with conformed cases of this condition include endocrine diseases, thyroidal dysfunctions, malnutrition, malignancies, and stress. Once the trigger pattern is initiated, about 20-50% of the scalp hairs are induced to progress through the telogen phase until they are completely lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpidemiological Data\n\n\n\nNormally, only about 5 - 10% of hairs enter the telogen phase. The increased transition to the telogen phase experienced by telogen effluvium patients can cause complete balding.\n\n\nIn anagen effluvium, hair shedding is replaced with hair breakage. The cortex cells of the hair follicles and other epidermal structures with a high mitotic division rate are most susceptible to this breakage effect. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are widely studies causes of this formed of diffused hair loss. Within 4 weeks, hair loss becomes noticeable with over 80% of the scalp hair is already affected.

    "section": "Pathophysiology of Androgenic Alopecia",
    "text": "Pathophysiology of Androgenic Alopecia\nAndrogenic alopecia is perhaps the most discussed alopecia form in the medical world. Many studies and clinical surveys have been conducted to understand its etiologies and disease course. Globally, there is a race distribution pattern on the incidence of androgenic alopecia. It is commonly diagnosed in the White population, followed by the Asian, African Americans, Native Americans, and Eskimos.\nIn a normal hair growth cycle, activation of the androgen receptors shortens the growth phase of each hair strand. Factors that directly modify the activation ate of this process present an overbearing effect on hair development. In androgenic alopecia, the activation trigger is excessively presented, leading to follicular miniaturization as the growth phase significantly shortens. Hair shafts produced becomes thin, short, and weakly penetrate through the epidermis. In this form, the strands are shed off easily. Hair loss occurs bi-temporarily, starting at the anterior hairline progressively moves over the scalp. At the vertex scalp, hair loss begins centrally and radiates outwards in all directions. Although hair loss is patterned, the site of hair loss is affected differently. In some men, balding is more prominent at the front, and in others, at the crown.\n\nConventional Therapy Methods\nConventionally, many forms of alopecia are treated with the same therapy protocol. In androgenic alopecia, management plans are directed at combatting the excessive activation of the androgenic receptors. This attempt to normalize the length of the growth phase requires extensive clinical monitoring, and many times a multi-therapy approach. The conventional therapy currently available struggles to directly reduce the rate of follicular miniaturization and promote hair replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescription Data\n\n\n\nCurrent trends in prescription data suggests that the FDA-approved drugs, topical Minoxidil and Finasteride are the most prescribed medications for androgenic alopecia.\n\n\nTopical minoxidil is presented in different dosage strengths and is available over-the-counter. This option requires a 4 to 6-month blind administration before an improvement is expected. As the period elapses, a comprehensive clinical review is conducted to determine modifications. Patients struggle with adherence and many times, this leads to therapy failure. Many research studies suggest the use of high-strength topical minoxidil formulation on a short therapy course.\nMinoxidil, as a potassium channel blocker improves blood vessel dilation. This action triggers the circulation of more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the hair follicles. A rich supply of these components reportedly promotes the anagen phase and corrects alopecia in all its forms. Finasteride is another medication conventionally used in alopecia therapy regimens. It is commonly prescribed as a 1 mg daily regimen. As a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, this drug has shown significant efficacy in improving hair growth at the vertex [(Piraccini et al. 2021; Libecco and Bergfeld 2004)]. In female alopecia patients, finasteride has however shown inconsistent results. This, in parts, explains why it is considered contraindicated in females.\nOther drugs used in the off-label management of alopecia forms include Dutasteride, Cyproterone, and oral antiandrogens including spironolactone, prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost. Surgical options including hair transplant and laser treatment. These non-drug therapy options are also considered effective. Many patients opt for these as they are short-course therapies and are cosmetically satisfactory."

    "text": "Considering HOBRASIO as a Novel Integrative Therapy Option\nCurrently, the therapy options available for the management of alopecia forms produce inconsistent results. To a large part, the long-course drug therapies do not guarantee recovery, as their results cannot be easily reproductive in a patient population. Novel management methods using combination therapy options are quickly gaining traction in the medical community.\nThese methods involve the combination of proven conventional and new therapies to rapidly improve hair growth or slow down hair loss. In addition to their effectiveness, these methods have shown considerable advantages in safety, skin compatibility, and result consistency.\nThe Hybrid Object Rejuvenation (HOBRASIO) option provides an evidence-based therapy for alopecia forms by combining different rejuvenation methods. This innovation improves hair growth in both gender and poses no medical threat to the patients. Although this method is new, there exists much research backing its usefulness in modern cosmetology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a 2016 review published by the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy, researchers recommended the use of combined therapy options in a same-day management model. Studies like this explore the possibilities and provide scientific backing for novel dermatology treatments like HOBRASIO\n\n\nIn the management of alopecia forms, HOBRASIO combines several proven strategies in a single therapy regimen. This innovation secures optimal therapy effects for epidermal rejuvenation. In addition to its regenerative effect on follicles, this novel therapy option also provides soft tissue augmentation and skin rejuvenation effects.\nUnlike in conventional management with fixed therapy modalities for alopecia, HOBRASIO combines different options within the limits of safety, for different skin types. This single approach makes it effective in promoting hair replacement at the vertex or the scalp. Patients are guaranteed a consistent result with a short-course therapy and no adherence problems."

    "text": "Hobrasio Regimen For Alopecia Forms\nAs a hybrid cosmetic therapy approach, HOBRASIO explores the combination of Minoxidil, low laser therapy, and Micro-needling for epidermal and superficial dermal problems. Alopecia falls right into this category. A combination of these three therapies into a single regimen triggers physiological modifications that solve alopecia.\nCombining these invasive procedures produces a desired clinical outcome that is considered cosmetically satisfactory. Early initiation of treatment can also effectively stop the transition to ‘alopecia universalis’ or ‘alopecia totalis.’\n\nMicro-needling\n\nMicro-needling is a relatively new therapy option in modern cosmetology. However, since its introduction in the early 90s, micro-needling has been used for different dermatological problems including skin rejuvenation, acne scarring, melisma, and surgical scar repair (Fertig et al. 2017).\nThis minimally invasive procedure involves the use of multiple fine needles to create micro-punctures in the skin. This action triggers a physiologic cascade that triggers vascularization and the release of growth factors.\nThese growth factors initiate the rapid formation of collagen and elastin. In its use for alopecia, micro-needling triggers the release of platelet-derived growth factors and epidermal factors that activate the hair bulge. Proteins releases in this cascade also stimulate dermal stems cells and subsequent hair formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a 2014 case study published by the Journal of Cutaneous and Anesthetic Surgery, a group of researchers demonstrated how micro-needling can effectively treat alopecia forms.\n\n\n\nLow Laser Therapy\n\nLow laser therapy is an innovative approach in modern dermatology that explores the physics of photons (particles of Light) for epidermal rejuvenation. Generally, this option utilizes low-intensity light at the red or near-infrared wavelength to alter the physiology of the epidermal cells (Yoon et al. 2021).\nIn a large part, the precise mechanism of action of low laser therapy in hair replacement has not yet been established. However, multiple research studies suggest that low laser stimulates the anagen re-entry of telogen hair follicles.\nBy modifying the normal cycle of hair growth, the low laser stimulates the increase in hair growth rate, hair density, and diameter. Hair shedding decreases and the primary symptoms of alopecia clinically resolve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the FDA approved the first Low laser device for use as a safe option for the treatment of alopecia. Since then, clinicians have increasingly recommended low laser therapy for many alopecia patients\n\n\n\nMinoxidil\n\nMinoxidil was originally developed as an anti-hypertensive. Post-market surveillance data suggested that this drug triggers hypertrichosis –excessive hair growth. Subsequently, topical formulations of minoxidil were developed and re-introduced for the treatment of alopecia. For several decades, minoxidil topical formulations have served primary purposes in hair growth therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinicians Should Note\n\n\n\nDespite its wide application today, the exact mechanism of action of minoxidil for hair regeneration remain unestablished\n\n\nResearch studies have however postulated different hypotheses for this action. Minoxidil plays a key role in cell proliferation at the early stages.\nMinoxidil sulfate, a metabolite of minoxidil has also been proposed to be involved in the hair rejuvenation effects of minoxidil [(Suchonwanit, Thammarucha, and Leerunyakul 2019; Randolph and Tosti 2021; Villani et al. 2021)]. Minoxidil also stimulates prostaglandin E production in a cascade of reactions that ends with the stimulation of the hair follicles.\nThis triggers the continuous growth of hair as the growth stage becomes elongated. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted to prove the efficacy of minoxidil at different concentrations for the treatment of androgenic alopecia."

A popular high point linked with FACS is the ease and efficiency with which this method can isolate multiple cells (hundreds of thousands of cells) in split timing.\n\n\n\n\nFACS\n\n\n\nThe protocol of operation of cell isolation in FACS is centered on\n\nCell size\nCell Fluorescence Properties\nCell Granularity\n\nThis method is generally considered efficient and fast as it creates a unique system of cell sorting. When in use, FACS can easily isolate designated cells from a tissue sample or genome by exploring the ability of these cells to fluorescence when pre-labeled.\nThis unique property of the FACS cell-sorting protocol explains its popularity in the study f single viral particles in a poll or assemblage of mixed viral genome. When compared with recently developed protocols, such as the Direct Library Preparation Plus, the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting method is limited in application.\nIn this method, it is compulsory that a bulk of the cell assemblage be prepared as sorting material and samples must be prepared in solution. Earlier observation reports also holds that the fluorescent dye used in cell labeling can damage the viability of cells or influence the inherent properties of the single cells1.\n\n\n2. Microfluids\nThe shortcomings with FACS, especially the need for an abundant cell assemblage and risk of losing cell viability, led to the development of Microfluidics. This method employs a protocol setting completely different in mechanism to the FACS.\nMicrofluidics is widely used in\n\nMicrobiology\nEmbryonic development studies\nNeurobiology\n\nBasically, the Microfluidics setup7 uses a highly integrated system to achieve single cell culture and sequencing by manipulating small volumes of a few hundreds of micro-liters of fluids. As the nomenclature suggests, Microfluidics needs only a few volume of fluids in cell-based studies3.\n\n\n\n\nMicrofluidics Setup\n\n\n\nResearch institutes from around the world are currently experimenting with the feasibility of employing Microfluidics in human medicine especially in the areas of epigenomics sequencing and single cell whole-genome studies.\nIn the laboratories and microbiological studies, Microfluidics can effectively separate biological nanoparticles from tissues samples, cell cultures and cell assemblage. In a 2016 publication of Nature, the future of Microfluidics was examined based on coverage and advantage in cell sequencing6.\nReports from this review suggest that Microfluidics produces accurate results with a unique level of sensitivity in almost all research applications as reported. This method can also finely resolve nanoliter-to-picoliter volumes of samples in research studies that need timely analysis and effective outcomes in low volume fluids.\n\n\n3. Mechanical Micromanipulation\nAs an old and classic method in cell isolation and single-cell based studies, Mechanical Micromanipulation surely deserves an honorable mention. This manual method is cost-efficient and can only need cheap instrumentation especially when results are not needed to be extremely accurate.\nThis explains the continued use of Mechanical Micromanipulation in many Microbiology research laboratories around the world, despite the popularity of new methods. The Mechanical Micromanipulation setup only requires the mechanical suctioning of a single cell from a cell assemblage using a capillary pipette, microscope and other supporting instruments2.\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Manipulation setup\n\n\n\nCell isolation is not automatic and as such requires personnel guidance in the visual inspection of single-cell color features and morphological characteristics. The shortcoming of Mechanical Micromanipulation is centered on its manual processes.\nRanging from personnel faults, to mechanical shearing during manipulation and the possibility of cell damage, the shortcoming of Mechanical Micromanipulation appears to be unlimited in perspective.\nAlthough, the microscope provides a means of exact cell identification in a tissue sample, an unskilled personnel might misidentify the target cell and the whole process is time-consuming. These shortcoming are solved in Microfluidics and the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting method"

    "text": "Direct Library Preparation Method: The Latest Innovation in Cell Sequencing\nThe Direct Library Preparation method of cell sequencing was developed as a scalable single-cell whole-genome sequencing platform. Compared to other methods before this innovation, the Direct Library Preparation instrumentation is perfectly designed for accuracy, high resolution and unparalleled efficiency in cell isolation experiments and research findings.\nRecently published biotech reviews on this subject matter have positioned DLP as more than just an innovation in cell isolation studies. By large, it ushers in an era where microbiology and human medicine can optimally benefit from technology.\n\n\n\n\nDLP\n\n\n\nThe instrumentation boasts of open source computational methods, image-based object recognition and commodity instrument. This innovation is widely used in many research finding for the identification of clonal populations and their corresponding genomic features.\nDirect Library Preparation has shown useful prospects in\n\nTumor studies\nMicrobiology\nNeurology\nImmunology\nEmbryonic development studies\n\nBy extension, there are theoretical evidences supporting the use of this novel method in genome heterogeneity studies, mutational processes and findings on clonal evolution in healthy and cancer tissues. Early reviews and studies on the Direct Library Preparation platform showed that it can capture a high-resolution microscopy images of cells. These images are captured as the cells navigates a transparent nozzle as they settle in wells.\nImage output allows for exact cell identification and separation. All single cell captures are lysed processes to produce unique sequencing inserts. Standard illumina protocols and allows the researcher to pool and sequence indexed libraries at the desired coverage depth.\nThe wide application of Direct Library Preparation in the research might also be linked with the innovative advantage of the development and inclusion of an open-source, cloud compatible software infrastructure. This inclusion allows the bulk storage of data and metadata produced in all sequencing and imaging processes. Based on a researcher’s preference, the result generated from this storage can be loaded into selected data visualization and assessment platform for further studies, data exploration and quality control.\nAn early report on the application of Direct Library Preparation was published by a January 2020 issue of Nature Methods. The authors in this study use Direct Library Preparation to generate a resource of 51,926 single-cell genomes and matched cell images from diverse cell types including cell lines, xenograft and diagnostic samples with limited material. The resource bulk generated allows the study of variations in mitotic mis-segregation rates across tissues types and genotypes. As expected, the analysis of genomic matches obtained and images captured aided in establishing a correlation between cellular morphology and genome ploidy states4.\nThis single review on DLP argued a case for its integration into medical sciences especially in tumor and embryonic development studies. This study, as reported, also documented the calculation of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inferences of clonal phylogenies using aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles. As a last result in this study, the authors also reported clone-specific chromosomal aneuploidy in polyclonal populations as defined by joint analysis of the listed features. Speculations on the readiness of DLP’s use in human medicine are currently on debate.\nHowever, there are enough evidence to argue for its usefulness in tumor studies. By allowing the measurement of clonal replication states and rare aneuploidy patterns of single cells, DLP is evidently suitable for embryonic development and tumor tracking studies.\n\nComparison, Benefits and Features\nMicrofluidics, Mechanical Micromanipulation and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting are methods developed early in cell isolation and single cell studies. However, the shortcoming of these methods have called for their replacement in many research studies and laboratory institutes.\nThe biggest challenge posed by these methods is that samples must be prepared in suspension and thus, the spatial location of the target cells in the tissues or cell cultures can be lost easily. Surprisingly, the Direct Library Preparation protocol is affordable and can be widely used on scalable methods in human and cellular studies.\nThis method is also widely considered a low bias method that can allow the spontaneous and in-depth analysis of variety of samples. In essence, this method can be effectively employed in genomic matching of tissues, cell assemblage and cell cultures.\n\n\nHow Direct Library Preparation Solves the Problems in Cell Sequencing\nUnlike other methods, the Direct Library Preparation method also allows the determination of copy number variations (CNV), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), phylogenic reconstructions and cluster analyses.\nThe arrays of benefits of using the DLP in research and experimental findings are limitless and include:\n\nLow reagent cost\nHigh quality of singe cell whole genome libraries\nLineage reconstructions\nUse in the analysis of any cell and nuclei from 5 to 80 micrometer.\n\nTo a large extent, DLP solved the myriads of shortcomings associated with the early methods employed in cell sequencing researches. Using the Direct Library Preparation (DLP) method in single-cell whole-genome sequencing of clinical sample is currently considered one of the best approach for cell isolation in modern biotechnology.\nThis is coming at a time when Direct Library Preparation in human medicine is increasingly becoming a topic of global scientific interest8. With time, more adoption of Direct Library Preparation method is expected to be recorded in many research facilities around the world."

    "text": "At some points in their lifecycle, humans experience a distressing pattern of hair loss that is linked to multiple causes. Clinically, this condition is reviewed, diagnosed, and treated as ‘Alopecia.’ In many regions of the globe, alopecia is a common primary health complaint, constituting a huge portion of telemedicine services and point-of-care therapies. The pattern of hair loss in the population depends on different variables including genetic pool, healthcare efficiency index, common comorbidities, and multiple environmental triggers. The psychosocial complications arising from this condition makes prompt diagnosis and management important determinant of prognosis.\n\n\n\nAlopecia Areata\n\nThis non-scaring form of hair loss is commonly described as Circular Hair Loss. Although it rarely occurs in clustered populations, it is considered the second most popular form of alopecia. Approximately, the lifetime prevalence of alopecia areata is pegged at 2% with an almost equal incidence on both men and women. Diagnosis for this form of alopecia is common before age 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nResearch studies have confirmed multiple etiologies for alopecia areata, with the most published studies concluding on the possibility of a hereditary component. People most commonly diagnosed with alopecia areata were likely to have a few comorbidities including thyroidal dysfunctions, autoimmune conditions, atopy, and vitiligo.\n\n\nAlopecia areata presents as smooth, round patches with complete loss of hair and a retained follicular opening on the scalp and beard regions. Right on the edges of the affected region, short fragmented hair with thin shafts develops in isolated forms. Therapy delay may trigger a quick transition to ‘alopecia totalis’ –complete scalp balding or ‘alopecia universalis’ –hair loss on the body surface. The commonly adopted therapy protocols for alopecia areata involve a holistic modulation of the identified triggered for hair loss. Minoxidil, UVA therapy, and the experimental use of immunosuppressive drugs are common management options.\n\nAndrogenic Alopecia\n\nAlso described as ‘Patterned Hair Loss’, androgenic hair loss is considered the most commonly reported form of alopecia in both men and women. Data review from early studies published by the Southern Medical Journal and Dermatologic Surgery suggests that about half of androgenic alopecia male patients were diagnosed by age 50. Whereas, about 40% of androgenic alopecia female patients were diagnosed by age 70. In men, it is presented as a receding frontline with biphasic hair loss and shaft thinning. The presentation in women is slightly different with shaft thinning observed only at the crown as the anterior hairline remains preserved. In many diagnosed cases, symptoms first occur at puberty ad progress slowly until the hair loss pattern becomes noticeable.\nA diagnosis for androgenic alopecia includes a review of clinical history, family history, and pattern of symptom presentation. Many times, androgenic alopecia transitions into complete baldness in men, however, this transition is rare in female patients. Adopted therapy protocols for this condition include the recent, FDA-approved medication, Minoxidil, commercially retailed as Rogaine. Other medications including Finasteride are considered as off-label therapy options for androgenic alopecia.\n\nDiffuse Alopecia Forms\n\nUnlike the forms of alopecia mentioned already, this group of alopecia forms affects the scalp uniformly. In acute telogen effluvium, hair loss can persist for about 6 months, with shedding triggers expressed 2-4 months earlier. Diffuse alopecia forms are of multiple etiologies. The most common etiologies linked with conformed cases of this condition include endocrine diseases, thyroidal dysfunctions, malnutrition, malignancies, and stress. Once the trigger pattern is initiated, about 20-50% of the scalp hairs are induced to progress through the telogen phase until they are completely lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpidemiological Data\n\n\n\nNormally, only about 5 - 10% of hairs enter the telogen phase. The increased transition to the telogen phase experienced by telogen effluvium patients can cause complete balding.\n\n\nIn anagen effluvium, hair shedding is replaced with hair breakage. The cortex cells of the hair follicles and other epidermal structures with a high mitotic division rate are most susceptible to this breakage effect. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are widely studies causes of this formed of diffused hair loss. Within 4 weeks, hair loss becomes noticeable with over 80% of the scalp hair is already affected. Termination of the trigger factor has shown a noticeable reduction in hair breakage. Minoxidil remains the most promising therapy option for anagen effluvium."

The most common etiologies linked with conformed cases of this condition include endocrine diseases, thyroidal dysfunctions, malnutrition, malignancies, and stress. Once the trigger pattern is initiated, about 20-50% of the scalp hairs are induced to progress through the telogen phase until they are completely lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpidemiological Data\n\n\n\nNormally, only about 5 - 10% of hairs enter the telogen phase. The increased transition to the telogen phase experienced by telogen effluvium patients can cause complete balding.\n\n\nIn anagen effluvium, hair shedding is replaced with hair breakage. The cortex cells of the hair follicles and other epidermal structures with a high mitotic division rate are most susceptible to this breakage effect. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are widely studies causes of this formed of diffused hair loss. Within 4 weeks, hair loss becomes noticeable with over 80% of the scalp hair is already affected. Termination of the trigger factor has shown a noticeable reduction in hair breakage. Minoxidil remains the most promising therapy option for anagen effluvium."

    "text": "Discussing Available Data Trends\nThe mortality rate of tuberculosis in healthy and immuno-compromised persons have triggered a global response to stem the tide of infection. In 2017, over 10 million incident cases of tuberculosis was recorded, with mortality set at 1.57 million deaths (WHO, 2018). The stats recorded showed a steadily decline in the global Tuberculosis burden as recorded in the previous year –about 1.8% decline in incident cases and 3.9% decline in global deaths due to tuberculosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout DOTS\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization introduce the DOTS strategy in 2000, until it was replaced by the Stop TB strategy in 2006.\n\n\nBoth strategies were aimed at halting and reversing tuberculosis incidence and reducing the tuberculosis prevalence and mortality by 50% by 2015. In 2016, the World Health Organization commenced a post-2015 tuberculosis strategy (End TB Strategy) aimed at ending the global tuberculosis epidemic. This new strategy was expected to cover the 2016 – 2035 TB analysis period, achieving a 35% reduction in absolute number of TB deaths and a 20% reduction in TB incidence by 2020.\n\nAs it stands, the rate of decline in incidence and death will not be enough to meet the WHO End TB strategy target for 2035. Substantial reduction in tuberculosis deaths will be necessary to meet the first installment aim by 2030.\n\nVariations in the epidemiology of TB have been consistently tracked by geographical distribution and, now by sex and age distribution. Africa constitutes one of the highest regional prevalence rate of tuberculosis. Co-infection with HIV is considered an important factor in the rate of TB epidemic in this region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA compromised immune system has been linked with increased mortality in people infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis1\n\n\nIn Asia, the data recorded by the WHO datasheet on global Tuberculosis burden show similarity to that in Africa. The incidence rate revealed a rising case of tuberculosis infection in the region. However, compared to Africa, there is a lower burden of HIV infection in this region. Other risk factors such as poverty, undernutrition, poor hygiene control in crowded spaces and lack of adequate medical care contributes to the driving force of tuberculosis infection in this region.\nIn Europe, the cluster of countries only contributes about 3% to the global incidence of tuberculosis in 2016. The burden of tuberculosis in this region tilts toward therapy failure and not risk factors that substantially increases new infections as in Africa and Asia. Multi-drug resistant TB strains (MDR TB) is considered a major problem in Europe. The proportion of MDR TB cases in this region is about 5 times higher compared with other regions, posing a major challenge in treating cases of tuberculosis. Enhanced strategies might be needed to combat the prevalence of TB in this region. Experts have suggested pre-testing and treatment for multi-drug resistant TB, screening for coinfection with HIV among the vulnerable groups and addressed the challenges posed by poverty and malnutrition.\nReviews on the global burden of tuberculosis opened new insights into how to better control annual incidence rate of tuberculosis in a bid to meet the target for 2035. As at 2016, an estimated one third of the global population has latent TB infection and are at direct risk for a secondary infection that can significantly increases future risk for TB3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the WHO recognized this problem and released an updated guideline for the management of Latent TB.\n\n\nThis therapy guideline was slowly implemented in many countries and current data suggest that the coverage level falls below the End TB strategy target for 2025. Treatment of latent TB can directly impact the incidence and prevalence rate recorded for tuberculosis infections globally in subsequent years\nThe World Health Organization and regional health bodies continuously examine and optimized the Stop TB strategies as it applies in their regions. Many scientific reviews have called for regional annual reports on incidence and mortality to better estimate the improvement in the global TB burden. This can also help for objective assessment of the WHO data sheet on tuberculosis annually and to track improvement in epidemic control. The data sheet on Tuberculosis presented by WHO in 2016, was reportedly based on direct reflections from national surveys on tuberculosis by 24 countries. This accounts for 68% of the global burden of this infection. Standard adjustments on data allow for underreporting or under-diagnosing for 134 countries constituting 15% of the global TB burden.\nDuring the period tracked in this paper, the estimation of death caused by tuberculosis was based on national registration of cases of death for 129 countries constituting 57% of the estimated tuberculosis death globally. WHO also used estimates produced by the Institute of Health Metrics to estimate tuberculosis death in 18 countries. Currently, the epidemiologic estimates only show modest improvement in the global TB burden, as determined by steadily declining incidence, mortality and prevalence rate, pegged at an average of 1.4% annually. Intensified and concerted effort are needed to meet the targets set for 2035 and beyond.\nInnovative approaches and modification of the strategy guidelines are required in regions with a significant annual burden of tuberculosis. These include pre-screening for HIV co-infection, implementation of latent TB therapy guidelines, innovative TB therapy regimen and ensuring hygiene in clustered regions, especially in Africa and Asia. These strategies are tipped to significantly decreases the global burden of TB in subsequent years."

    "section": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nAs of January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the total number of COVID-19 infection cases as over 98 million globally. Up to the date of this review, the last weekly epidemiological report declared the total number of global death rates are over 2 million since the start of the pandemic (Sohrabi et al. 2020). Announcing COVID-19 as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the Coronavirus disease has significantly reshaped life and daily living around every corner of the world.\nIts impact on the medical practice and surgical management have been most devastating. Although the race for a treatment protocol and vaccine started earlier, healthcare providers globally felt the crushing blow of this novel viral infection. No doubt, the health dangers of delayed surgical procedures are well-defined.\nAs the reported cases of daily infection surged significantly, the need to develop and measure the variables that directly measures the impacts of COVID-19 infections on clinical procedures also developed. The data and evidence gathered from such measures were projected to guide updated reviews of medical practices as the pandemic rages on (Chen et al. 2020).\nIn health facilities with active cases of COVID-19, physicians were forced to update treatment protocols and closely monitor parameters such as drug effectiveness, surgical outcomes, and disease resolution index (Liang et al. 2020). Research teams worked in different healthcare facilities, including a COVID-19 Centre, studying the clinical outcomes of thoracic surgery in the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOur goal, with this research, is to evaluate the clinical outcomes following elective thoracic surgery –Lobectomies – in a participant pool of 93 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in non-COVID-19 and a COVID-19 center."

    "section": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "DISCUSSION\nMany research studies have highlighted the post-operative risks and outcome impacts of COVID-19 on patients undergoing surgical procedures, , while others have directly documented the morbidity scores of delayed surgical resection (Samson et al. 2015). Al-Jabir et al. (2020) carefully recommended the protocols for disinfection and surgical maneuvers for anesthesiologists and surgeons performing thoracic surgery on a patient.\nThe general index for post-operative pulmonary complications is low; however, the presence of comorbidities and viral infections can affect the diagnostic workup and surgical outcome. With reference to an earlier report (Aminian et al. 2020) confirming that undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 infection may complicate post-operative recovery. (al-jabir2020also?) also defined the modalities for post-operative care and elective ICU admissions in surgical cases with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.\nAt the time of compiling these results, the team was not aware of any similar reports exactly detailing the outcome of elective lung lobectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This report, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind globally, reconciling the parameters defining standardized patient care with the outcomes of elective surgery as affected by COVID-19 infection. Although, there are studies proposing new ideas on emergency thoracic surgery patient care irrespective of COVID-19 (Maurizi and Rendina 2020) On admission, preoperative history of comorbidities and at-risk behaviors were documented for every patient.\nAt the time of research reporting, our team was unaware of any large-scale cohort studies statistically evaluating the post-operative risks and complications of lobectomies associated with a COVID-19 infection. The only relevant studies, in this case, were published by Lei et al. (2020). Lei’s team reports statistical data on the outcomes and clinical characteristics as observed in 34 surgical cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.\nThree high-mortality thoracic surgery cases were captured; however, the majority of the surgical cases were on oncological surgeries with no patient confirmed of an active COVID-19 infection prior to surgery. The data from Wuhan suggested that the percentage of patients requiring post-operative critical care (44.1%) was higher than the general population of patients on admission with COVID-19-related health complications.\nLimited by lockdown protocols of the pandemic, our team decided to incorporate telemedicine into the standardized care plan drafted for these patients. As a safe and modern method of remote healthcare delivery, the study population was introduced to Microsoft tams and Pando –a mobile app –for pre-and post-surgical monitoring. The procedures and schedule for communication and feedback analysis from these platforms followed early protocols in remote healthcare delivery for surgical cases.\nCerfolio, Ferrari-Light, and Shah (2019) earlier described the safety and efficiency of telemedicine in delivering preoperative and post-operative clinical care to patients scheduled for thoracic surgery.  The submissions of this early research explained how the authors confirmed that telemedicine safely determines oncologic surgical resectability and patient fitness and providing outstanding outcomes in surgical care.\nOur team is aware of an earlier study exploring the prevalence of smoking rate and comorbidities in evaluating the relationship between disease severity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caliskan and Saylan (2020) concluded in this study that smoking, cardiac disease, congestive pulmonary diseases, and old age are risk factors for intensive care admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients.\nThe comorbidities and at-risk behaviors documented in our study pool include smoking [13 current smokers, 54 ex-smokers], renal failure [13], steroid therapy [4], and diabetes [2 diets controlled, 1 insulin-dependent, 10 oral therapy, and diet controlled].\nAlthough the lobectomies captured in this report were elective, patient care was directed at providing efficient clinical care in line with COVID-19 protocol guidance for triage of operations for thoracic malignancies (Antonoff et al. 2020). It is important to emphasize the integration of telemedicine using the Pando mobile app to deliver medical care during this study.\nWe believe that the zero morbidity rate recorded during this study is in part aided by utilizing technology in the postoperative and preoperative setting for patient evaluation and to triage any potential complications (Grenda, Whang, and Evans 2020). The mean length of post-surgical hospital stay recorded was also compared with pre-COVID data for the same period (March – September) in 2019. We had a significant reduction in the mean length of post-surgical hospital stay, with the 2020 value pegged at 5 as against the higher 2019 value at 7.\nOf the 93 patients observed during this study, 72 developed no primary complications, with the remaining 21 patients developing various primary complications ranging from acute post-surgical troublesome pain, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, mild gastric dilatation, persistent air leak, surgical emphysema, post-operative pneumonia, and other acute abdominal conditions requiring laparotomy.\nThe team recorded and analyzed the relationship between these complications and other variables of this study, including the mean of length of post-surgical hospital stay. The group of patients that developed other acute abdominal conditions requiring laparotomy as a primary complication stayed the longest in the hospital at a mean length of post-surgical stay of 5 days.\nPost-operative secondary complications diagnosed in the study cases were also documented.  Eighty-nine patients developed no secondary complications as supportive care for primary complications were swiftly initiated. However, one patient developed mild arrhythmia requiring no treatment other than drugs, one patient developed atelectasis (collapse), another was diagnosed with persistent air leak, and the last patient developed a case of pleural effusion of an unknown cause. We recorded no case of tertiary complications. Therapy was considered largely successful as all members of the ninety-three patient pool were discharged with no recorded of mortality.\nThe discharged destinations were different for our patients, with two patients alive and transferred to another hospital/department and ninety-one patients discharged home. None of the patients contracted the COVID-19 post-operatively and during the entire stay in the hospital. In an earlier report conducted on patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 552 hospitals in China, the overall incubation time was pegged at 4.0 days (interquartile range 2 – 7).\nThis study case stayed for more than the confirmed incubation periods and recorded no suspicious symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. Post-operative care is expected to continue with the already established COVID-19 protocol guidance for the triage of thoracic malignancy operations (Li et al. 2020)."

We achieved this feat despite working across three different COVID-19 centers. Our junior staff was actively involved in patient care protocols as they were drafted to cover the intensive care unit at these sites.\nThe result findings in this case resonate with earlier submissions on the outcomes of researches earlier conducted to evaluate the safety of patients and providers in lung cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chang et al. 2020). Effective communication using teams and Pando allowed th researchers to deliver safe patient care."

    "text": "Sulbutiamine is a lipid-soluble derivative of thiamine originally developed in the 60’s by Japanese scientists as an adjunctive treatment for the management of symptom spectrum linked closely with Vitamin B deficiency. Sold under the brand name ‘Arcalion’, Sulbutiamine has since been modified and explored in the management of asthenia, depression, erectile dysfunction, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetic neuropathy.\nThe rationale behind the development of Sulbutiamine is simple –a compound that can easily increase and sustain the level of brain thiamine levels was needed to reverse the symptoms of thiamine deficiency. Thiamine is polar, making it soluble in water and decreasing its rate of penetration of the blood-brain barrier. As an oxidized derivative of thiamine, Sulbutiamine is a non-polar dimer of thiamine that crosses the blood-brain barrier and metabolized to release more thiamine molecules in the brain.\nThis profile increases the bioavailability of thiamine in the brain, decreases thiamine metabolism and combats thiamine deficiency. This is the sole basis for the cognitive-enhancing properties of Sulbutiamine."

    "text": "Sulbutiamine in Clinical Care\n\n1. Cognitive Enhancement\nSulbutiamine is known to give an extra kick when needed. This is the primary reason for its use among millions of people. As a synthetic derivative of thiamine, it induces a mild stimulatory effect by enhancing the actions of dopamine at the expense of other catecholamine. Sulbutiamine is preferred to amphetamines and other cognitive-enhancing therapies as it presents no significant adverse effects on the users. As a non-prescription drug, it is considered a supplement therapy in Alzheimer’s patients as it increases attention span and improves treatment indices.\n\n\n2. Long-term Memory Formation\nMany clinical evidence and research results are currently supporting the use of Sulbutiamine in the stimulation of long-term memory formation. Sulbutiamine interacts significantly with neurotransmitters directly involved in memory formation –choline, dopamine and glutamate responds readily to the modulatory effects of Sulbutiamine in humans.\nInvestigating the role of Sulbutiamine in long-term memory formation, a research study published by the Journal of Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior submitted that this compound mediates an increase in hippocampal cholinergic activity by inducing an uptick in sodium dependent high affinity choline uptake1. The steps involved are beyond the scope of this review.\nSummarily, Sulbutiamine increases the rate impulse transmission in the brain receptor and improves glutamate flow in a bid to enhancing memory formation. There are also studies explaining the effectiveness of Sulbutiamine in reversing the adverse effects of amnesia-inducing drugs on memory formation.\n\n\n3. Erectile Dysfunction Suplementary Therapy\nCurrently, there are enough claims and anecdotal evidences to fuel a clinical investigation about the usefulness of Sulbutiamine in reversing erectile dysfunction. In 2005, a study published by the Russian journal, Urologiia, detailed the usefulness of Sulbutiamine in the management of psychogenic erectile dysfunction. In this study, 20 patients with confirmed cases of psychogenic erectile dysfunction received optimal does of Sulbutiamine over a course of 30 days. In some patients with preexisting arterial disorders, an improvement in cavernous arterial blood flow was recorded.\n\n\n4. Improved Mood and Reduction in Anxiety Levels\nThough not yet extensively proven by clinical research standards, there are many theories suggesting that Sulbutiamine can actively elevate mood and reduce anxiety in users. As initially discussed, Sulbutiamine significantly effects the activities of the body’s excitatory neurotransmitters especially glutamate and dopamine. In normal humans, dopamine is linked with emotional response, motivation and feelings of pleasure.\nBy increasing dopaminergic transmission, Sulbutiamine can be expected to improve mood. In the year 2000, this basis was investigated in a clinical research published by L’Encephale. The efficacy of Sulbutiamine on the symptoms of patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) was examined in a placebo control trial. This study confirmed that Sulbutiamine is effective in rehabilitating patients in their social and family life functioning3.\n\n\n5. Energy Boost in Chronic Fatigue\nJudging from a few clinical studies, Sulbutiamine has proven to be useful in the treatment of posttraumatic fatigue characterized by low energy levels. Since its use with anti-infective medications is not contraindicated, many physicians now explore this combination posttraumatic patients to boost mood and increase energy levels. A non-randomized observational study investigating the effect of Sulbutiamine in patients with infection associated asthenia was by published by The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India in 2003.\nAn inspection of the primary outcome data revealed that the number of patients with complete resolution of all asthenic symptoms was over 50%. In some patients, severe asthenia was significantly reduced, however, response was greater in patients with acute infection and symptom presentation4. Sulbutiamine is also effective in the management of fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis and in persistent bouts of unexplained fatigue."

    "text": "Sulbutiamine’s Pharmacology\nAs an emerging drug component, different medical enquiries have been conducted to investigate the mechanism by which Sulbutiamine exerts its biochemical effects in humans. These findings revealed a multi-system mechanism amplified by Sulbutamine’s interaction with neuronal cells, biological antioxidants, neurotransmitters and different regions of the brain. In addition to increasing circulating thiamine levels, other documented mechanism of action of Sulbutiamine in human subjects include:\n\nSulbutiamine increases the activities of Dopamine and Glutamate in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain. A study published in 2000 by Neuroscience Letters concluded that Sulbutiamine exerts a modulatory effect on dopaminergic and glutaminergic cortical transmission by decreasing kainite binding sites and increasing Dopamine (D1) binding sites4.\nSulbutiamine decreases the rate of neuronal cell death (as induced by serum deprivation) by a dose-dependent stimulation of the activities of glutathione (GSH) and Glutathione-S-transferase. A research study published in the Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin revealed that Sulbutiamine inhibits oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxidative species (ROS) in neuronal cells –an action that consequently reduces brain cell death4.\nIn experimental models, Sulbutiamine has been shown to increase hippocampal cholinergic activity by a direct effect on central cholinergic pathway. This mechanism is however complex and still under further scrutiny by different research groups. However, different publications have confirmed that chromic administration of Sulbutiamine directly improves the ability of experimental rats to form long term memory.\n\nSulbutiamine has also been proven to increase energy use in the brain by directly stimulating the levels of thiamine triphosphate2."

It is presented for sale predominantly in two forms –bulk powder packs and capsules. Currently, there exists no definitive publication or official directive about the safety profile of Sulbutiamine in humans.\nHowever, long-term usage data has suggested that Sulbutiamine is generally tolerated in humans at doses up to 600mg/day. There are no reported cases of toxicity in humans. For safety concerns, it is advisable that this drug product be taken with food.\nContinuous use of Sulbutiamine for a period of time exceeding 4 weeks is unadvisable as the safety of its long-term use is unknown. Anecdotal reports of tolerance in humans has also been documented. Optimal dose for use is pegged at 200-600 mg taken twice or three times daily depending on indication for use and expert recommendation."

The lipophilic nature of the molecule ensures that it is accumulated in the tissues and also crosses the blood-brain barrier to effect neurotropic actions. Biochemical effects are noticed within 30 minutes of administration and peak effect is experienced after 3 hours. Sulbutiamine has a half-life of 5 hours and it is excreted mainly in the urine."

This emerging practice involves the combination of Sulbutiamine with drugs and drug products that can enhance its biochemical effects. The combination of Sulbutiamine with optimal doses of Cholinergics increases the central effect of Sulbutiamine on the cholinergic system.\nThe adverse effects of some drugs are more pronounced when used for long periods in high doses. Sulbutiamine may be co-administered with suboptimal doses of these drugs to effects the needed clinical response with any significant adverse effect."

    "text": "Substance abuse and drug addiction constitute a major public health problem in different regions of the world. Interestingly, these problems are as old as the history of drug use and recently, different literature studies have made impressive attempts to study and specifically categorize drug use problems.\nIn 2017, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported an estimated value of 20 million people with an alcohol or drug use disorder. On a broad scope, dug use disorders are categorized as Opioid use disorder (OUD), Substance use disorders (SUD) and alcohol use disorders (“Chapter 8. Substance Use Disorders,” n.d.).\nAlcohol use disorders are the most widely documented addiction problems in the U.S and Europe. Regardless of the spectrum of designation, substance use disorders have been linked with increasing rates of psychiatric comorbidities including anxiety, suicidal tendencies and transient mood disorders. The societal and economic burden caused by these has necessitated scientific interest in the development of management plans and treatment options for drug addiction problems.\nTreatment options for substance abuse patients were developed and made prominently popular in the 20th century. Within a few years, a variety of management options based on psychosocial basis and behavioral observations have been developed and used as models for different randomized trials (Magill and Ray 2009). These conventional approach to treatment include brief intervention, community reinforced approach, motivational interviewing, contingency management, facilitated therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy.\nAs published, conclusions from this study suggests that these methods are effective in drug addiction care programs especially when paired with abstinence-contingent incentives. In 2009, the report of a meta-analysis randomized control trial studying the potency of cognitive-behavioral treatment on drug addiction patients was published by the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs (Paliwal, Hyman, and Sinha 2008).\nThe conclusion of this report also supported early submissions and fueled the drive for novel treatment methods with more conclusive treatment outcomes.The search for a novel treatment approach for use in drug addiction programs was intensified when reports of relapse and recurrent substance use increased. In 2008, the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence published a report suggesting that the conventional approach to addiction therapy are susceptible to relapse and a high incidence of substance use recurrence.\nTechnology-based therapy methods for drug addiction programs were developed and delivered through technological platforms including social network sites, smartphone applications websites and digital forums."

    "text": "Digital Tools for Therapists in Addiction Care Programs\nCompared with the conventional methods, digital recovery services are readily available, convenient, privately delivered on a low budget, sustained over long durations and not necessarily delivered in a clinical setting (Boumparis, Schulte, and Riper 2019). Most importantly, these digital tools are linked with different technology-based methods of evaluating therapy effectiveness.\n\nSmartphone Applications\n\nDigital tools delivered on mobile phones are readily available, convenient for use, and can easily replace the face-to-face interviews and personal assignments of the conventional methods. Digital tools on smartphones are designed as advanced software platforms with varied functions and capabilities that supports a personalized addiction care plan. Modules on these applications increases patients’ awareness of their addiction problem, help patients assess daily alcohol use, document weekly recovery plans and provide a health publications detailing verified information about craving triggers and dangers of substance abuse (Dulin et al. 2013). Primarily, this digital intervention method offers users a coping strategy to reduce rate of hazardous drinking and also combat psychological distress that can cause relapse.\nThe Alcohol Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) is a popular digital tool based on cognitive-relapse prevention technique, Marlette relapse-prevention system and a self-determination theory. Modules available for users include health information sources on addiction management, counselor support, self-assessment of recovery, and discussion groups. The cognitive-relapse prevention approach uses a GPS tracking prompts that remind users of their recovery goals on approaching a high-risk location.\nIn 2013, Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly published a report examining theory and empirical evidence basis on smartphone-based, self-administered intervention system for alcohol use disorders. Results of the pilot randomized trial provided evidence of smartphone-based tools’ effectiveness in managing alcohol use disorders.\n\nInteractive Voice Recognition\n\nThe interactive voice recognition (IVR) digital technology is a modern adaptation of motivational interviewing. It involves a telephone-based delivery of recorded scripts guiding users on the methods of abstinence and recovery assessment. Scheduled phone calls are made by the therapist to addiction patients discussing techniques of medication adherence, craving management, adverse effect observations and monitoring of daily substance use.\nVoice prompts from the therapists elicit a participant’s real time response using voice feedbacks or keypad responses. A series of correctly answered responses helps the therapist with vital data recording for recovery evaluation.In 2017, the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine published the report of a randomized controlled trial studying the effectiveness of interactive voice response with feedback intervention in outpatient treatment of substance use disorders.\nStudy results suggests that personalized feedback potentially improves recovery from addiction problems and that IVR is useful for repeated intervention as an adjunct to regular treatment (Andersson et al. 2016). The therapist simply evaluates a stream of user-centered feedback to grade recovery and effectiveness of care plan.\n\nSocial Media and Online Forums\n\nOnline forums offer reinforced social support for patients enrolled in an addiction care program. The therapist creates a virtual community of online users interacting with a team of expert professionals in addiction therapy. Clinicians have taken a step further by forming social media chat rooms and discussion threads that offer virtual support on self-administered therapy plan, recovery tracking and other expert-delivered interventions for addiction management.\nOver the years, there is an increasing emergence of sites offering support networks, free customized abstinence plans and validated information on substance use problems. This sites include Women for Sobriety, SMART (Self-management and Recovery Training) and Sober Recovery. The therapy idea for this tool is quite simple. These forums create a virtual interactive interface for the therapist and addicts. Therapists deliver a recovery goals and abstinence plans that suits a subgroup of enrolled participants. Participants reports addiction care data on daily substance use and substance craving frequency which helps the therapist track recovery and provide modifications of plans when necessary.\nRecently, different research reports supporting online forums as a viable digital tool for addiction programs has emerged. In 2014, National Institute on Drug Abuse has published an announcement detailing plans to fund different institutes exploring the use of social media and online forums to advance the scientific understanding of the management of substance use disorders and addiction problems."

For instance, in Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), participants fill questionnaires that help therapists assess, tests and identify the presence of alcohol use disorders. In contrast, the effectiveness of technology-based addiction therapy tools can be self-assessed. Features and software modules designed with the recovery apps allows participants of an addiction programs to share real-time information about their recovery and abstinence program.\nFollowing voice prompt feedback, keypad responses or real-time mood reports, the therapist can assess determinants including high risk situations, abstinence violation, defective coping strategy, lifestyle imbalances and substance cravings. Information supplied allows the therapist to comprehensively understand participants’ recovery journey and offer modifications to improve therapy when necessary (Marsch, Carroll, and Kiluk 2014)."

    "text": "Digital Tools as a Treatment Option\nIn 2006, Addiction published a report article on the rate and predictors of alcohol relapse after treatment. Study results suggests that about 80% of treated participants in a drug addiction program who experience short-term remission are likely to relapse fully (Moos and Moos 2006). This study has fueled many scientific interests in the study of alcohol relapse rates and the use of digital tools as a mainstream therapy plan.\nTherapists have proposed a remote alcohol monitoring therapy that involves the combination of a suitable addiction digital tool with a breathalyzer. This provides a patient-focused plan that responsibly task participants with the provision of documented proof of sobriety and accountability for substance use. This plan simply increases the participants’ awareness of their substance use problem and puts them in charge of their recovery plan as the therapist provides periodic evaluation of monitoring plan.\nIn updated assessment plans, digital tools can also present a relapse prevention model that completely replaces regular blood tests and evaluate immediate determinants and covert antecedents to substance use relapse (Marsch 2012). Incorporating digital tool into a monitoring plan as a treatment option reduces program entry barriers, eliminates geographic restrictions effects a lasting long-term personalized approach to addiction recovery. By extension, these tools have also been found to be effective in the management of depression and anxiety bouts secondary to substance use disorders.\nThe drive for the inclusion of technology-based tools into primary healthcare has received wide commendation around the world. This plan offers a new interesting role to addiction therapists and widen the range of available tools for recovery plans. With continuous research and development of digital addiction tools, the benefits of technology-based interventions in addiction care programs are no doubt, far reaching."

In the United Sates and many other pro-cannabis countries today, hemp - an industrial variation of cannabis sativa containing less than .3% THC, is the only legal source of cannabidiol. For many centuries, there have been different claims about the medical benefits of CBD derived from hemp. However, these claims remained largely unverified until the early 1970s. During this period, animal tests and a few human studies on the bioactivity of cannabinoids were conducted.\nEvidence from these studies make it easy to better understand how CBD and CBD-derived compounds can be beneficial in human medicine. Recent clinical studies have provided convincing evidence supporting the anxiolytic, analgesic, antipsychotic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties of CBD (Davies et al., 2019).\nYou might have heard about the CBD wonder drug ‘Epidiolex.’ In June 2018, the Food Drug Administration approved Epidiolex as the first CBD-based drug for the management of rare, severe epilepsy (Sekar., 2019). With one FDA approved CBD drug being approved by the FDA on the market, you can assume that the volume of research currently dedicated to developing new CBD products for use in humans is high – which it is. Studies on CBD have gone up drastically in the last few years since it was legalized in the US."

    "text": "CBD Hemp Flower\nThe Cannabis sativa plant is a dynamic plant with many useful parts. You can say every part of the cannabis plant serves a purpose and are sold for different value on the cannabis market. CBD hemp flower is on of the most sought after cannabis products. It is described the dried or raw hemp flower buds of the cannabis plant, containing less than 0.3 percent THC. CBD hemp flower can be sold under different names, including cannabis flower, hemp flower, CBG flower, and CBD flower.\nIn some countries, cannabis products with THC levels below 0.3 percent THC are classified as legal marijuana. CBD hemp flower contains no significant amounts of calories, fat cholesterol, lactose, and trans fat. Depending on the strain, hemp flowers can bloom and store variable quantities of secondary cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes. The flavonoid content of the hemp flower imparts the potent flavors and smell of the flower.\nSecondary cannabinoids are those cannabadinoid that are not THC or CBD in the cannabis sativa plant. Flavonoids and are contents of the hemp flower that imparts the vaious flavours and scents in the cannabis strains. Terpenes on the other hands, serves multiple multiple purposes –they imparts on flavor and complements the bioactivity of the principal cannabinoids in humans.\nIn the US, thanks to the Hemp Farm Bill of 2018, CBD derived from hemp plants that contains less than .3% thc, is legal and able to be sold in all 50 states. Depending on where you are located or where you are buying your hemp flower from, you can run into many different names for it: cbd hemp flower, cbd flower, cbg flower, hemp buds, and hemp cbd flower. Hemp flower is produced by cultivating the feminized hemp flower seeds in a greenhouse, indoor, or oudoor agriculture growing operation. Just like marijuana, hemp flower has many different strains, and each strain has a different compostion of the cannaboids, flavonoids, and terpenes.\nAn important feature of hemp flower you should never miss is its unique composition. You might have purchased a few cannabis products from the market and notice that some of these products are marked ‘full-spectrum cannabis products.’ As full-spectrum products, they are formulated from the cannabis plant and include compounds from the whole hemp plant. In essence, these products were not simply isolated cannabis compounds. Hemp flowers fall in this category. Depending on the cannabis strain, it contains a residual, THC, terpenes, and other phytocannabinoids that make using hemp flower instead of pure CBD an experience to relish.\n\nDifferenciating Between CBD and Hemp Flower\nRecently, the global cannabis consumer market noticed steady upticks in demand for CBD hemp flower. These demands were reasonably fueled by increased pro-cannabis regulations and the increased research reports on CBD hemp flower. Cannabis users simply desired to test this new method of consuming their favorite weed strain. As it stands, the demand for cannabis hemp flower is predicted to remain high, contributing to the projected market valuation of the global cannabis market in 2024 (Grand View Research, 2021).\nScientific inquiries into the properties of hemp flowers have also created new answers for cannabis enthusiasts about hemp flowers. However, these researches have also directly increased the public awareness of the medical and recreational benefits. So, how do you better understand what hemp flowers offer? What, if any, are the main differences between CBD hemp flower and CBG hemp flower? These questions should enlarge your horizon about the endless usage benefits of cannabis hemp flower also make you appreciate the mother plant better. The most widely researched and documented differences between CBD and CBG hemp flower include:\n\n1. Visual Features\nThis is perhaps the first difference you would notice between two cannabis products labeled as ‘CBD hemp flower’ and ‘CBG hemp flower.’ The visual features of the CBD hemp flower depend much on the strain from which it is derived. So, the appearance of the buds might be different across strains. CBG hemp flower, on the other hand, has more delicate trichomes than CBD hemp flower. Cannabis farmers take extra precautions during harvesting and curing to ensure that these trichomes are preserved in their original state.\n\n\n2. Phytocannabinoid Composition\nCannabis sativa contains over 400 phytocannabinoids present in pure and bounds forms with other compounds. These compounds are either singly or jointly responsible for the bioactive properties of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. These compounds are present in different quantities in different extracts and derivatives of the parent plant. Phytochemical distribution on a growing cannabis plant varies extensively (Andre et al., 2016). The hemp stem, leaf, bud, and trichomes have different phytocannabinoid distribution.\nCBD hemp flower and CBG hemp flower are different primarily in their dominant cannabinoid composition. CBG is directly derived from CBGA – a carboxylic acid that can form other cannabinoids. CBG flowers are derived from cannabis strains that are high in CBG. This makes CBG (Carbigerol) the dominant cannabinoid in the CBG hemp flower. In CBD hemp flower, however, cannabidiol (CBD) is the dominant cannabinoid.\n\n\n3. Slightly different Bioactivity\nCBD has been around for many years. Unlike CBD hemp flower, the focus on CBG hemp flower started a few years ago. These hemp types may have slightly different effects on cannabis users. Many reports are suggesting that CBG hemp provides a more energizing effect than CBD hemp flower. CBG hemp flower is also recommended as adjunct treatment of bacterial infections (Giovanni., 2008). However, the effects of CBG hemp flower in humans are not as pronounced and steady as with CBD hemp flower. The availability of each type of hemp flower is another primary difference between these products."

Endocannabinoids are structurally complex biological compounds made of amides, esters, and other derivatives of long-chain polyunsaturated compounds. Produced on-demand from lipid constituents of the body cells, these compounds act as biological mediators in cell signaling processes.\nThey are relatively unstable and sometimes produce no significant systemic action. Endocannabinoids and the enzymes responsible for their production and deactivation make up a complex biological network of the Endocannabinoid System (ECS).\nThe cannabinoid receptors provide a biological action point for the endocannabinoids on numerous target organs where they are present. Cannabinoids, including CBD and THC, act on these receptors to effect a biological action. This is why your favorite cannabis strains give you the euphoria, calms, and other recreational benefits you enjoy."

CBD Hemp Flower Gives You Flexibility and Variety in Cannabis Usage\nThis is perhaps the single most important reason you should consider switching to CBD hemp flower. Presenting cannabis as the hemp flower helps you creatively use the plant. Hemp flowers can be smoked like tobacco or incorporated into food products. The latter method of usage is the branding idea behind a new line of cannabis products –cannabis edibles. The dried hemp flower can be hand-rolled and smoked like a regular cannabis joint. When incorporated into food, the buds are mixed into a recipe, then cooked or baked.\nCBD, like THC and other phytochemicals present in the CBD hemp flowers, are soluble in fat. Infusing these products into oil or butter is a recommended method of consuming cannabis as a food.\n\n\n2. CBD Hemp Flower Gives the Entourage Effect\nCannabis users provide feedbacks describing the effects of many strains. This feedbacks help botanists and cannabis researchers to better understand and classify the different cannabis strains available today. Anecdotal reports from different users suggest that the ‘full spectrum’ cannabis products, by an unknown mechanism, exert a better therapeutic effect in humans compared to isolated CBD.\nDavid Mechoulam –the famous father of cannabis research, proceeded to investigate this claim and discovered the ‘Entourage Effect.’ The effect is a proposed mechanism explaining how THC acts in synergism with other components of the cannabis plant to modulate the biochemical effects of cannabis in humans.\nIn 2011, the British Journal of Pharmacology published the report of a study confirming that selective breeding of cannabis chemotypes rich in phytocannabinoids offer complementary effects that strengthen the therapeutic properties of cannabis extracts (Russo., 2011). This report confirmed the entourage effect earlier described by Mechoulam. Unlike pure CBD isolates, CBD hemp flower contains a trace amount of these phytocannabinoids. The medical and recreational benefits of using CBD hemp flower are pronounced compared with pure CBD isolates."

    "text": "FAQs on Hemp Flower\n\nWhat Percentage of CBD Should Hemp Flower Have\n\nThe CBD content of hemp flowers depends on the cannabis strains from which the hemp flower is produced. However, CBD hemp flower with a CBD content of 20% or more is considered a premium product.\n\nWhat is CBD Hemp Flower Used for?\n\nCBD hemp flower serves multiple purposes for both recreational and medical cannabis users. You can include it in your food recipe or simply smoke it as a joint. In medical science, it is recommended as a complementary therapy for the management of anxiety, sleep disorders, and pain. You can buy wholesale hemp flower online easily.\n\nHow Much CBD Hemp Flower Would it Take to Fail a Drug Test?\n\nCBD hemp flower contains high quantities of the non-psychoactive cannabinoid –CBD and very low quantities of the psychoactive cannabinoid –THC. Consuming high levels of THC can make you fail a drug test. We advise that you use hemp flowers responsibly as recommended by your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nHow Much CBD Hemp Flower Gives a full Medical/Recreational Effect?\n\nThere are no recommended dosing standards for CBD products as these products are still under human research trials. However, we advise you to start with a low quantity of CBD hemp flowers. You can increase this quantity gradually until you get the lowest amount that gives the desired effect. You can also consult your doctor on this.\n\nWhat is the Best CBD Flower for Relaxation\n\nYou might want to consider Hawaii Haze for its high levels of CBD and terpenes –Myrcene, Caryophyllene, Bisabol, and Borneol. It gives you a full-body relaxation effect with waves of warm citrus and sour diesel flavors. Super Sour Candy also provides a good relaxation effect."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nChronic kidney disease is associated with increasing age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and drug use. In Norway, USA and Australia, large scale screening programs undertaken in the 2000s indicated that more than 10% of the adult population have markers for chronic kidney disease [coresh2003?,chadban2003?,hallan2006?]. By 2030, the number of people on renal replacement therapy is expected to reach 5.4 million. About 2.3 – 7.1 1 million adults have reportedly died prematurely from lack of access to renal replacement therapy services3.\nIn a bid to properly check the prevalence and mortality rate of CKD, different national and international agencies have adopted strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of CKD. NSAIDs are commonly used in the general population for the control of pain associated with inflammation and migraine. This clinical case study describes a 55-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of CKD. He was prescribed an NSAID to manage his cluster headache. However, long term use of this NSAID worsened the CKD. His CKD resolved completely with dietary intervention and he subsequently halted the use of the NSAID."

    "text": "Case Introdudction\nChronic kidney disease describes long-tern loss of the kidney functions. It is generally characterized by kidney damage, abnormal albumin excretion and decreased kidney functioning persisting for more than three months. Therapy plans for CKD are comprehensive and require a systematic monitoring of Kidney function.\nIn 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Initiative (KDOQI) of the National Kidney Foundation defied the decreased kidney function in CKD as that of a glomerular filtration rate less tan 60mL/min/1.73m22. Reduction in the glomerular filtration rate is linked to the loss of functional nephrons and the reduction in renal mass. The most commonly documented complications associated with CKD include anemia, renal ostedystrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure.\nThe KDOQI guidelines classified CKD progression into five different stages for informed patient management. Patients at stages 1 (normal eGFR&gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 with persistent albuminuria), stage 2 (eGFR between 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2) and stage 3 (eGFR between 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) are generally asymptomatic. At stage 4 (eGFR between 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2) and stage 5 (eGFR &lt;15mL/min/1.73m2 w), patients experience symptoms suggesting metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalance and endocrine derangements.\nIn suspected cases, establishing a confirmed diagnosis for CKD involves conducting laboratory studies that directly measures kidney functioning. These includes serum albumin levels tests, lipid profile, urinalysis basic metabolic profile and complete blood count.\nClinical reviews and studies have implicated NSAIDs in the onset and progression of CKD. No steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly prescribed for analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in people with CKD. In the general adult population of the U.S., one in fifteen adults are actively medicating on NSAIDs. This class of drugs can limit renal blood flow, induce cytotoxicity, limits cell-mediated immune injury response and cause tubular obstruction through crystal formation and deposition.\nThese adverse drug effects of NSAIDs have been linked with the onset of CKD in healthy patients. Dietary interventions are becoming popular as supplementary or alternate therapy in the management of CKD. A low protein diet has been shown to improve the symptoms of CKD and also noticeably improve kidney functioning."

    "text": "Clinical Case Study\nThe patient is a 55-year-old man who presented to a Secondary Health Care Facility on account of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and Chronic Kidney Disease in October 2019. Patient present with a Stage 3 CKD characterized by eGFR of approximately 50 mL/min/1.73m2. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary venous disease, urinary tract disease cardiovascular disease or acute kidney infection. He stopped smoking about 35 years ago and had no known exposure to lead.\nBefore presentation, he had visited 3 nephrologists who confirmed that his CKD was triggered by his long history of medicating on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A review of his medication history revealed that he has been on Indomethacin (25mg 12hrly) for the management of cluster headache. The patient started medicating on Indomethacin since 2005, and ALEVE (??) before 2005.\nAfter the consultation, the patient consented to a diet-based intervention for symptomatic control of CKD. He lives a sedentary lifestyle and has no family history of Kidney disease. Diet therapy was designed as Standard American Diet involving a decreased intake of processed food, more animal protein and an increased consumption of more fruits and vegetable units daily.\nIn February 2020, the patient reported a controlled GERD and had reduced the dosage of indomethacin to 25 mg once daily. He was also switched from Omeprazole to Ranitidine as a maintenance therapy for the resolving GERD. Three months later, the frequency of indomethacin administration was reduced to 3-4 times daily and the patient commenced an 80% plant-based diet.\nBy December 2020, the patient was taken off Ranitidine as GERD had completely resolved. Indomethacin usage frequency was readjusted to once or twice in a week as the cluster headache had resolved significantly with no single flare up. The patient was commenced on a 90% plant-based diet with fruits and vegetables constituting about 8 servings per day.\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Laboratory results showing eGFR normalization trend in the patient\n\n\ntidyverse?\n\n\n\nFig.2: Creatinine level variation in the patient"

    "text": "Discussion\nThere is an accumulated volume of scientific evidence linking long-tern use of NSAIDs to the onset and progression of CKD. The 2008 National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidelines considers NSAIDs to be nephrotoxic and further contradicted its use in CKD patients. Dietary interventions have been proposed by many clinical studies as an alternate therapy for CKD remission in many patients. This is especially important in cases with multiple risk factors. In addition to a long-tern use of Indomethacin (an NSAID) this patient was on a default diet of high animal protein and diary.\nAccording to the United States National Academy of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein is pegged at 0.8g/kg/dad. However, on an average the US adult population consumes higher protein –about 1.3 -1.4 g/kg/day –largely from animal sources. Recent researches examining the link between Kidney health and high animal protein diets have suggested that these meals should be discourages in people with kidney diseases. Dietary protein intake in these diets increases intra-glomerular pressure with resultant glomerular hyper-filtration5. Compounded with long tern NSAIDs use, these diets increase the risk and progression of chronic kidney disease1.\nIn a sharp contrast a low protein diet with a Dietary Protein Intake (DPI) range of 0.6-0.8g/kg/day has been verified to lower intra-glomerular pressure in CKD patients6. When maintained over a long period of time, low protein diets with DPI lower than the initial recommendation can effect even slower progression of CKD in many patients4. In another resent meta-analysis of dietary trials in CKD patient, researchers confirmed that low protein diets are associated with lower End Stage Kidney Disease risk, lower serum phosphorus levels, higher serum bicarbonate and lower mortality rate in CKD patients7.\nIn this case study, dietary intervention for the management of chronic kidney disease was balanced on plant-based diets. Lin et al (11) provided an early evidence supporting plant-based diets as effective interventions in CKD patients. A later study conducted by Kim et al (12) confirmed that plant-based diet is associated with favorable kidney outcomes. Unlike previous studies, Kim et al used a large participant poll – 14,686 middle-aged adults –to strengthen the support of plant-based diets in decreasing the rate of progression of CKD.\nThe patient was placed initially on an 80% plant-based diet which was steadily increased to 90%. During this period, the daily servings of fruits and vegetables increased to 7-8 and animal-based protein was completed removed from the patient’s diet. This diet regimen improved the eGFR1 significantly from approximately 50 mL/min/1.73m2 at admission to &gt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 as at last clinical appointment. The creatinine level also decreased significantly to less than 1.2. The cluster headache prompting the need for Indomethacin (an NSAID) also completely resolved.\nThis case study provided further scientific support for plant-dominant low-protein diet as a dietary approach in the management of Chronic Kidney Disease. However, many patients remain uninformed about the role of diet in the reduction of the rate of CKD progression.\nCKD-specialized dietitians have a major role to play in increasing awareness for diet approaches in the management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Awareness is needed in the general population, regions with vulnerable population and among clinicians in general."

    "text": "Elements of Clinical Alcohol and Drug Addiction Care Programs\nVarious care programs and awareness campaigns have been activated in some regions based on therapy methods that have been confirmed to be effective over the years. Prevention modalities are a basic part of clinical alcohol and drug addiction care programs. These care programs are designed as a patient-focused approach incorporating pharmacotherapy plans with digital tools and hardware measuring tools to evaluate therapy. Currently, the newly recommended plan for alcohol addiction programs involves the fusion of psychotherapy and technology-based intervention (TBI) methods. TBIs in people with alcohol dependence in channeled in a two-way approach that encompasses digital support programs, alcohol blood level measurement and addiction treatment.\nThe role of technology-based interventions in reducing the rate of alcohol consumption are somewhat questionable and also complicated when discussed. However, the idea basically involves taking advantage of advancement in digital technology to drive the campaign against irresponsible use of alcohol products. Text messaging, interactive voice-recognition, and smart phone apps are the leading examples in this domain. In 2013, an early study evaluating the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in primary care settings for substance use programs was published by PLOS Medicine. Conclusions derived from over 75 controlled trials published in the review suggests that these methods improved the rate of patient adherence to therapy plans in substance abuse programs. This study has since scored a significant point for the inclusion of TBIs in alcohol care programs. Most importantly, technology-based interventions now replace traditional methods of evaluating alcohol use with rapid, convenient, and sensitive methods. Perhaps, the major setback to traditional methods of measuring blood alcohol levels is the limitation in accuracy. These methods are also considered to be relatively low on sensitivity and hence can be inadequate in substance-specific testing. Participants in clinical alcohol care programs often consider urine tests, as with other traditional methods, to be inconvenient and inefficient for document abstinence rate in continued-care programs.\nAs expected, clinical evaluation of alcohol use and rate of adherence to care programs are determined by measuring the level of blood alcohol content (BAC). The difficulties presented by traditional methods have fueled a quest for the development of modern methods based on technological innovations. Until recently, urine test and laboratory blood analysis are the main methods of measuring BAC.\nWith advances in technology-based interventions, breathalyzers have been developed as a modern approach to measuring BAC. Breathalyzers are sensitive digital hardware tools that can detect blood alcohol content and produce on-the-spot reproducible results. The different breathalyzer brands currently available in the market generally uses any of three innovative technologies –Fuel cell testers, Infrared Spectrometer, and Semiconductor oxide-based testers."

These tools evaluate adherence and provides a remote support for patients on substance use disorder treatments and addiction care plans. It is now common to find government-sponsored programs using hardware tools in facilitating routine workshops, individual and family counselling, and individualized use plans as regards alcohol and drug monitoring.\nAs regards alcohol addiction, breathalyzers help patients embrace sobriety and recover quickly from addiction. Breathalyzers and other hardware tool in substances use evaluations are becoming increasingly popular in the U.S and Europe. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal published an article review of DynamiCare Health –an evidence-based platform that supports and reward substance abuse patients on a deliberate path to recovery. This article also included comments on the infusion of cash by venture capitalists into startups focused on developing novel hardware and digital-based tools for use in alcohol addiction programs. Unfortunately, a lot of people still consider hardware tools especially breathalyzers as devices merely used in DUI cases.\nSemiconductor oxide-based breathalyzers uses an ethanol-sensitive sensor to detect and measure BAC. By using a tin-oxide material cheaper than platinum fuel cell sensor technology, this breathalyzer brands are particularly useful in self-monitoring of blood alcohol content. Customized brands of this same technology is used by labs and low-volume professional testing agents in alcohol testing procedures. Fuel cell breathalyzers are portable, sensitive and extremely sensitive.\nRelying on an electrochemical process, the fuel cell consists of two platinum electrodes and a porous acid-electrolyte setup. Platinum oxidizes the alcohol content present in a stream of exhaled breath and produces protons, electrons and acetic acid. Electrons, as an indication of current, flows through a circuit setup and provides a reproducible estimate of the blood alcohol content. Fuel cell sensors are used by law enforcement officers for roadside alcohol screening and by clinics and primary care centers managing alcoholics. Breathalyzers based on the techniques of infrared spectrometry are large and are mainly suitable for confirmatory tests of independent results of BAC. Alcohol content in a sample is analyzed by determining the rate at which alcohol molecules absorbs infrared light of a specific wavelength."

    "text": "Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) Testing\nBlood alcohol content testing is important in medical and legal foregrounds. BAC results reveal the level of alcohol in the blood as direct measurement of intoxication level and impairment. Depending on volume consumed, impairments associated with heavy alcohol includes impairment in depth perception, reasoning, peripheral vision, reflexes, and gross motor skills. In Europe and many states of the U.S., drivers and operators of heavy machinery are considered legally intoxicated at a BAC level of .08% and above.\nResults lower than this threshold can be interpreted in relation to the impairments associated with the BAC level. For instance, at 0.02%, a user might be judged to have an impaired sense of judgment, and at .05%, a user might be judged to have lost control of the small muscles resulting in reduced alertness and poor coordination during physical activities. At .08%, the impairment noticed include loss of balance, slower reaction rate, slurred speech, loss of visual acuity, loss of hearing and difficulty in detecting danger. With loss in visual acuity and reduced reaction time, a driver finds it difficult to control speed limit or recognize traffic signals.\nImpairments are more pronounced at a BAC level of .10% as it becomes difficult for drivers under the influence to maintain lane position or machinery operators under the influence to recognize the right controls. At .15% and above, there is loss of consciousness and memory with an associated breathing difficulty that can eventually leads to death. These evaluations are important in legal cases bordering on determining BAC levels ."

It is common practice in different countries to order for a BAC test immediately after an auto crash with the possibility that alcohol might play a major role in cognitive impairment. BAC results might also be ordered as a part of random drug test at workplaces and in organized sporting activities. Some life insurance policies also require that the insured presents periodic BAC results that proves abstinence from alcohol. In all these instances, the point is to prove sobriety and abstinence from alcohol use.\nIn medical practice, on-the-spot BAC tests might be required to ascertain the remote cause of confusion or poor coordination. BAC tests are particularly important in clinical alcohol and drug addiction programs. Subsequent tests performed over a period of time can adequately evaluate the effectiveness of a technology-based intervention (TBI) method adopted for an addiction care plan. In a continued-care plan, reliable alcohol tests assess the level of after-care abstinence from alcohol, recovery rate and alcohol consumption rate monitoring."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bio-wearables are fast becoming one of the most popular medical accessories of the twenty-first century. This claim is no doubt drawn from the rapidly expanding market size of the wearable medical device globally. In a 2022 market analysis review, the Grand View Research team published market share trends valued the global wearable medical device market size at USD 21.3 billion in 2021. Judging from projected sales and revenue, this value is expected to expand at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 28.1% by 2030.\nLargely, the devices in this market are subdivided into two broad categories – those that show a limited range of health data and those with more intuitive designs for monitoring health data in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. Depending on the design and the medical indications for its use, some of these devices may require a medical prescription for their acquisition. With significant changes in the landscape of diagnostic services and patients, monitoring the technologies powering these innovative devices have been consistently improved over the years. Abbott’s Lingo line of bio-wearables is worthy of honorable mention.\n“Health tech is a big part of CES. It isn’t new to CES, but health innovation has certainly taken on a new urgency since we last gathered two years ago in Las Vegas”\nThese were the word of Gary Shapiro, president, and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, as he introduced Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abbott to the stage at the Consumer Electronics Show. Ford would go on to dazzle his audience, speaking for an extended period on different wonderful ideas and concepts about digital healthcare data monitoring.\nSpeaking at the event Abbott Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford remarked; “Technology gives us the power to digitize, decentralize and democratize healthcare, create a shared language between you and your doctor – and put more control of your health in your hands.”\nIn a style paying tribute to the company’s many innovations over the years, Ford would go on and on introducing scientists, doctors, and other healthcare providers whose lives and jobs have been positively impacted by Abbott’s devices. To mention a few, the following professionals illustrated how Abbott has revamped the healthcare data monitoring landscape over the last couple of years; • Tyrone Morris, a heart failure patient who was given six months to live, shared his story of how he beat the odds thanks to three separate Abbott devices: HeartMate 3iv, CardioMEMSv , and an implantable defibrillator. Today, Morris owns a barbecue catering business and food trucks in Humble, Texas, where he specializes in low-sodium recipes.\n• United Airlines’ Managing Director of Hospitality & Planning Aaron McMillan and Dr. Patrice Harris, co-founder, and CEO of eMed, a digital health company democratizing healthcare through its Digital-Point-of-Care™ platform, described how they came together with Abbott to help people fly confidently and conveniently with BinaxNOW COVID-19 Home Testsvi. United customers can take the proctored tests when traveling and have those results seamlessly confirmed by Abbott’s NAVICA app and verified through United’s Travel Ready Center.\n• Dr. Fiona Gupta of Mount Sinai Health System in New York highlighted how she uses the NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, a first-of-its-kind technology in the U.S., that provides people with deep brain stimulation remotely, so physicians can optimize and adjust treatments over cellular or Wi-Fi while Parkinson’s and chronic pain patients consult with them from the comfort of their living rooms.\n• The head of the University of Southern California’s Center for Body Computing Dr. Leslie Saxon shared her vision of “Lifecare,” which addresses everything from preventing sudden deaths to enhancing human performance.\n• Dr. Mary Rodgers, an Abbott virus hunter, shared how a first-of-its-kind network called the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition – stretching from Brazil to Senegal to Thailand – is working to identify new viruses and help stop them before they can spread.\n• Dr. Hakim Bouzamondo, head of Nutrition research and development at Abbott, shared how the science behind the microbiome can optimize overall health with personalized nutrition.\nCommenting on the different accounts of these professionals, Ford, a native of Brazil who has been with Abbott for 25 years said; \"These are stories about the convergence of health and technology to empower human lives,\"\nHowever, Ford's keynote address took an interesting turn when he unexpectedly introduced what would be a new product line in Abbott.\n\"Healthtech is at an inflection point. We're creating a future that will bring you and your loved one's care that is more personal and precise and will take human capabilities to entirely new levels. A future where people can practically manage their health—decentralize and democratize healthcare. With the right tools, we can give everyone the best chance to live their best lives.\"\nAbbott is developing a new line of bio-wearables similar in style to the current freestyle Libre Sensors, in a plan to extend its bio-wearables market share globally. The new product line, dubbed \"Lingo\" will be based on an existing diabetes monitoring technology with the added feature of the capability to track biological levels of glucose, ketones, alcohol, and lactate with a smartphone interface.\nThis preexisting monitoring technology, the FreeStyle Libre, was originally launched in 2014 and designed to provide a painless and safe option for diabetes monitoring their glucose level. This new line of bio-wearables would be designed to expand the operational capabilities of the FreeStyle Libre system.\nCommenting on the newly improved health monitoring technology, Robert ford explained how Abbot had transitioned from just diabetes digital care to a comprehensive biomarker monitoring care with immense benefits for athletes, the aged, and the medically vulnerable. Ford admitted;\n\"Diabetes was our first priority, and we wanted to get it right. Now we have the evidence, and the expertise, that comes from three and a half million users [of the Freestyle Libre], and we're going to take it to the next level.\""

    "text": "All About Abbott’s Popular Sensor Tech\nAbbot's mission statement was simple – live your best life, now and in the future. Not only has Abbott taken this statement, the company has also become a popular brand championing novel products in cardiovascular health, diabetes care, diagnostics medicine, neuromodulation nutrition, and pharmaceuticals. By its contribution to the global digital health monitoring devices, Abbott has also become a market leader in point-of-care testing, remote heart failure monitoring, glucose monitoring, blood and plasm screening, pediatric nutrition, and adult nutrition. Abbott pride itself in putting science and innovation to work – a claim that has led to a host of digital innovations in bio-marker tracking aimed at health optimizations. \nIt all started with the FreeStyle Liber sensor technology for monitoring glucose levels in diabetics and athletes. With a digital interface connected to a smartphone, Abbott's FreeStyle Liber sensor seamlessly replaced the use of a painful fingerstick with a painless scan for diabetics. Designed for ages 4 and above, this technology also offers real-time customizations about notifications on the level of glucose in the body. FreeStyle Liber practically help users understand the trend of glucose level fluctuations in their body. In people with significant diurnal fluctuations, this technology can help them make better decisions on glucose intake during the day.\nWith a strong market presence in 160 countries serving tens of millions of users, Abbott has grown to control a huge chunk of the global bio-wearable market. This perhaps is evidenced by the recent announcement of Lingo – a more comprehensive biomarker tracker. Based on existing Abbott's FreeStyle Libre diabetes monitoring technology, Lingo is expected to expand the frontiers of digital health monitoring systems globally."

    "section": "Unveiling Lingo - Abbott’s New Consumer Bio-wearable Line",
    "text": "Unveiling Lingo - Abbott’s New Consumer Bio-wearable Line\nAbbott's new product line is called 'Lingo.' It appears the naming was more than just a random afterthought. Abbott's marketing pitch for this product since its first announcement has consistently emphasized how 'Lingo understands and translates the body's unique language.'\nDuring the company's keynote address at the CES, Abbott announced that Lingo's fundamental design is aimed at understanding and translating the body's unique language. By scientific extension, the body's unique language as monitored and explored over the years is expressed as random fluctuations in the biological levels of hormones, enzymes, and metabolic biomarkers.\nThe idea of monitoring glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels as a vital aspect of diabetic and cardiovascular health management has been around for a while. Recently, there have been multiple scientific studies supporting Abbott's new endeavor of expanding the range of biomarkers trackable digitally with a smartphone interface as a method of improving overall health.\nIn a recent publication of the Diabetes Metabolism Research and Reviews, a group of scientists observed the trends of glucose, lactate, and ketones during anaerobic and aerobic exercise in different human study populations with type 1 diabetes. Francesca De Rider and his colleagues draw multiple insights from this study. Perhaps, the most important one is about how the levels of these biomarkers fluctuate randomly based on the health conditions of humans.\nData from such measurements will ultimately help users and healthcare providers optimize therapy regimens, nutrition plans, and exercise schedules. It is safe to imagine that Abbott's Lingo would one day pioneer a global push for personalized medical care.\nPerhaps, Abbott's and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford was not exaggerating when he said:\n\"Diabetes was our [Abbott] first priority, and we wanted to get it right, so we focused intently on it. Now that we have the evidence and the expertise that comes from 3.5 million users, we're going to take it to the next level. We're going to translate a wide range of biometric signals: glucose, ketones, lactate, and alcohol.\"\nBy offering a window into the body, Abbott's new product line is sure to give consumers premium value for every cent spent. Although Lingo is still very much in development, preliminary tests to understand its effectiveness, safety, and measure of accuracy have been conducted. Eliud Kipchoge, a Pro long-distance runner has since used the Lingo technology to plan his training and nutrition schedules in the lead-up to running the world's first sub-two-hour marathon. For a runner like Eluid, and by extension all athletes, Lingo is designed to provide a real-time update of glucose, lactate, alcohol, and important metabolic biomarkers.\nThese measurements help team doctors and personal trainers make informed decisions on weight management, nutrition type, energy optimization, and sleep habit. Although it appears futuristic, Abbott's claims on the technical capabilities of Lingo make this seems available in a couple of months.\nIn addition to glucose level measurements, Lingo's Sensor Technology will also be able to detect a user's ketone levels in real-time. The health benefits of ketone updates are simple without bounds. This will help athletes and other routine Lingo users detect when their bodies enter a state of ketosis. For athletes, lactate sensors can also help understand how rapidly the muscles build up lactic acid during exercises. In other people, the Lingo ketone monitor will help detect and understand the pattern of ketosis. At ketosis, the body replaces the default energy store for body by burning fat instead of glucose.\nThis metabolic state happens when the body's glucose stores drain down as a result of low-carb intake. As the body breaks down ketones instead of carbs, it produces a large number of byproducts called ketones. In diabetics, Lingo will expand on the capabilities of FreeStyle Liber by going one step further from just measuring fluctuations in glucose levels. In this population, Lingo could function as a continuous ketone monitoring device warning users when they are fast approaching diabetic ketoacidosis – a serious, life-threatening complication of diabetes.\nSpeaking on the technical accuracy of Lingo to also perfectly detect, monitor, and record the body levels of alcohol, Ford said;\n\"It [Lingo] could one day connect to users' vehicles to help prevent drunk driving and monitor alcohol intake, potentially helping you decide how much of Abbott's Pedialyte they need after whatever you did last night\"\nConsidering the huge economic cost of drunk driving and the consequences involved, stakeholders hope someday, Lingo might provide an accurate option for monitoring blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Theoretically, Ford's bold statement about the possibilities of measuring BAC with Lingo sometime in the future is based on how the body metabolizes alcohol by default. To do this, Lingo's sensor technology will be equipped to detect the levels of alcohol biomarkers present in the skin and, perhaps, the blood. Considering the huge milestones Abbott has achieved in the field of biomarker sensing, an alcohol-sensing device is perhaps not a big challenge. \nAlthough based on the FreeStyle Liber technology, Lingo is not solely intended for diabetics nor designed to be used in influencing medical decisions. This helps make sure that the Lingo is not considered an alternative to proven medical methods or used as a cure for life-threatening metabolic conditions. Lingo will follow the easy-to-use designs as other Abbott bio-wearables. Ford's speech also hints at possible compatibility with an accompanying smartphone interface and popular patch designs.\nAs with FreeStyle Liber, Lingo will be perfectly compatible with a quality hypoallergenic adhesive patch like the ones designed by notjustapatch. These patch designs feature a wave pattern form for adhesions and respiration with a combination of spandex and cotton in percentages that allow for easy use on the skin and muscles."

    "text": "Just Lingo? What Else in Abbott Innovating?\nIt appears Lingo will not be the only product Abbot is planning to roll out soon. In his keynote speech, Ford also revealed the company's proposed plans to develop a new line of diagnostic tests to be circulated widely across the globe. These new additions, he remarked, will be designed on the same platform as the i-STAT blood test for traumatic brain injury and the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test for COVID-19. In his words,\n\"These simple tests will become more widely available for people to do at home. They're going to talk to our phones, and they're going to communicate with our doctors. The future of decentralized and democratized testing will enable us to have the right test at the right place at the right time and will give everyone actionable next steps.\""

    "text": "Beyond Lingo - Abbott’s Adventures in Digital Health Biowearables and Devices\nIn addition to the Lingo portfolio, Abbott's press releases have mentioned a few other life-changing technologies not intended for medical use. Although these devices will no doubt help improve personal health data tracking, Abbott's disclaimers consistently explained that they are not intended for use in screening, diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation, prevention, and monitoring of diseases. The HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assists System is another of Abbott's revolutionary projects.\nHeartmate 3 is designed to provide both short and long ten mechanical circulatory support in adults and pediatric patients with advanced refractory ventricular heart failure. Recommended based on a patient's body surface area, this innovation has removed the usual medical bottlenecks in monitoring and ensuring proper circulation in patients with left ventricular heart failure.\nThe CardioMEMS™ HF System definitely deserves a mention in any review of Abbott's amazing product portfolio. CardioMEMS™ deploys a novel wireless technology for monitoring and measuring pulmonary artery pressure based on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure patients who have been hospitalized on account of heart failure in the previous year. Although not also indicated for diagnosis or cure, this system improves on any existing technology deployed for this same purpose.\nToday, physicians and primary healthcare providers consider CardioMEMS™ data in the management of heart failure and other complicated cardiovascular disorders. As published in a press release, Abbott's research team explained how the CardioMEMS™ hemodynamic data can help achieve the goal of reducing the rate of hospitalizations secondary to heart failure globally.\nIn its commitment to adapt seamlessly and respond innovatively to medical emergencies, Abbott recently developed the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test. This has since received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization. Currently, Abbott's BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test is indicated only for the detection of proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWith the recent announcement, it is evident that Abbott's planned to take control of the global bio-wearables market with many different innovations. For an average user, these innovations come across as a smart, viable replacement for conventional monitoring methods that are invasive and most times, painful. With the addition of Lingo, Abbott is expanding the reach of Medtech and creating smart monitoring devices that help clinicians better understand and translate the body's unique language."

    "text": "Home-based Energy Devices\nEssentially, home-based energy devices constitute an impedance that directly converts electrical energy to thermal energy. Designed as easy-to-use skincare routine devices, home-based RF devices are a major part of the hybrid skin rejuvenation strategy. The manufacturing standards for these devices might be slightly different. However, the instructions for use and safety guidelines are similar. The critical temperature needed to initiate collagen repair ranges from 57 – 75 degrees Celsius, with average therapeutic levels depending on skin types (Khan and Khalid 2021).\nHome-based RF energy devices, compared to the non-home-based alternatives, represent advanced innovation in cosmetic repair and the beauty of dermatological science. With the introduction and approval of home-based RF energy devices, the trend of cosmetic care is changing steadily (Britt and Marcus 2017). People can now afford RF devices for the personal management of wrinkles, sagging, and accelerated skin aging. As expected, the consumer response was a steady shift from long-hour, expensive cosmetic clinic appointments to a self-serviced at-home skincare routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Valuation\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the home medical equipment market value was estimated at $30.54 billion. By 2027, the value is expected to reach $56.45 billion with therapeutic care equipment tipped as the major contributor (Cohen et al. 2021).\n\n\nThe designs for these devices follow the same principle; the conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy at levels safe for dermal application. Thermal energy flows through the tissues from a point of entry to a point of exit through electrodes. Depending on the design, the electrode types on home-based RF energy devices can be mono polar (Mono-polar radio-frequency therapy) or bipolar (Bipolar radio-frequency therapy). The energy field created by these electrodes is converted into thermal energy, a process that eventually stimulates collagen denaturation and synthesis.\n\n\n\nFig.1: Monopolar Radio-frequency Application in Cosmetic Repair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.2: Bipolar Radiofrequency Application in Cosmetic Repair"

The objective of radio-frequency therapy is simple: induction of controlled thermal energy in the deep layers of the skin initiates a cycle of collagen changes and conformation. Commonly used as a therapy for skin laxity, RF produces controlled upward fluctuations in tissue temperature using a high-frequency alternating current (Araújo et al. 2015).\nThe heat supplied varies, depending on the current, behavior of the electrodes, and the impedance level of the tissue. Energy levels supplied also directly depend on the target tissues and the rate of collagen conformation."

    "text": "How RF Pulsed Energy Changes Collagen Conformation\nHybrid skin rejuvenation strategies, as an innovative approach in cosmetic skin repair, focus on the skin’s collagen and elastic fiber matrix. By providing a biological scaffolding over the subcutaneous tissues, the integrity of this collagen network determines the firmness and elasticity of the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollagen Decline\n\n\n\nOn an average estimate, the adult skin losses about 1% of its dermal collagen composition every year (Ganceviciene et al. 2012).\n\n\nWith advanced age, this intricate collagen-elastin fiber arrangement loosens as a direct consequence of collagen degradation and an altered collagen replacement. A disrupted collagen network is physically observed as paper-like wrinkles and a slacked skin texture.\nSub-surface heating of the skin tissues distributes a burst of thermal energy through the collagen matrix. Once the collagen fibers are heated, the cross-links are disrupted. At the therapeutic thermal level, collagen fibers undergo denaturation causing the triple-helix formation to shrink and unwind. Collagen denaturation is reportedly dependent on the exposure time and the thermal energy level. As a biological response to collagen denaturation, a complex cycle of natural wound healing is initiated. Radiofrequency energy distribution in the collagen matrix ultimately induces colagenneosynthesis (Kao et al. 2013).\nThe extent of collagen denaturation, fibroblast activation, fibroplasia, and collagen reformation depends on skin type, exposure time, and thermal energy distribution. According to reported case studies, collagen shrinkage occurs to a certain depth followed by colagenneosynthesis in the superficial layers. In hybrid skin rejuvenation therapy, RF treatment also increases blood perfusion, supporting natural healing and fibroblast activity necessary for cosmetic repair."

The science supporting collagen synthesis using pulsed radio-frequency energy is a recurring theme in dermatology studies. In a 2013 publication of the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, researchers described how pulsed radio-frequency energy-treated skin defects were characterized by dermal cell proliferation and increased collagen synthesis in animal models.\nCollagen is a naturally-occurring family of proteins with over 25 types described so far in biological systems. The complex processes orchestrating collagens formation occur both extracellularly and intracellularly in the fibroblast cells.\n\n\n\nFig.3: Collagen Synthesis\n\n\nStructurally, collagen is composed of elongated fibrils wound in a triple helix of two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Several amino acid sequences including Glycine-X-Hydroxyproline and Glycine-Proline-X are found in the collagen matrix. Alpha chains form the bedrock of collagen formation. Two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 combine to form to procollagen. Extracellular modification of procollagen strands produces tropocollagen molecules. On further processing, tropocollagen molecules are covalently bonded to form collagen fibrils. Multiple collagen fibers aggregate to produce the different types of collagen fibers found in the skin (Onursal et al. 2021)."

By stimulating collagen synthesis, these devices restore the pristine nature of the skin matrix, firming its texture and reversing the visible signs of physiological aging. As thermal energy denatures the collagen fibers, heat pulse initiates collagen synthesis through the natural response to wound healing. The in vivo response to thermal wound healing constitutes the inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling stages.\nDermal health application breaks the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the collagen fibers, resulting in denaturation and immediate contraction. Further synthesis, deposition, and remodeling of new collagen fibers increase the overall collagen volume and integrity. This explains the firmness and the improved skin texture noticed almost immediately. With home-based RF energy devices, visible clinical results are achieved within the first few months of therapy."

Level 4 staging involves invasive cosmetic repair procedures conducted in the Dermatology clinic. Reserved as a last resort, level 4 is only recommended for patients with no significant cosmetic improvement from level 3 therapies."

    "text": "Home-based Energy Devices\nEssentially, home-based energy devices constitute an impedance that directly converts electrical energy to thermal energy. Designed as easy-to-use skincare routine devices, home-based RF devices are a major part of the hybrid skin rejuvenation strategy. The manufacturing standards for these devices might be slightly different. However, the instructions for use and safety guidelines are similar. The critical temperature needed to initiate collagen repair ranges from 57 – 75 degrees Celsius, with average therapeutic levels depending on skin types (Khan and Khalid 2021).\nHome-based RF energy devices, compared to the non-home-based alternatives, represent advanced innovation in cosmetic repair and the beauty of dermatological science. With the introduction and approval of home-based RF energy devices, the trend of cosmetic care is changing steadily (Britt and Marcus 2017). People can now afford RF devices for the personal management of wrinkles, sagging, and accelerated skin aging. As expected, the consumer response was a steady shift from long-hour, expensive cosmetic clinic appointments to a self-serviced at-home skincare routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Valuation\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the home medical equipment market value was estimated at $30.54 billion. By 2027, the value is expected to reach $56.45 billion with therapeutic care equipment tipped as the major contributor (Cohen et al. 2021).\n\n\nThe designs for these devices follow the same principle; the conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy at levels safe for dermal application. Thermal energy flows through the tissues from a point of entry to a point of exit through electrodes. Depending on the design, the electrode types on home-based RF energy devices can be mono polar (Mono-polar radio-frequency therapy) or bipolar (Bipolar radio-frequency therapy). The energy field created by these electrodes is converted into thermal energy, a process that eventually stimulates collagen denaturation and synthesis.\n\n\n\nFig.1: Monopolar Radio-frequency Application in Cosmetic Repair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.2: Bipolar Radiofrequency Application in Cosmetic Repair"

The objective of radio-frequency therapy is simple: induction of controlled thermal energy in the deep layers of the skin initiates a cycle of collagen changes and conformation. Commonly used as a therapy for skin laxity, RF produces controlled upward fluctuations in tissue temperature using a high-frequency alternating current (Araújo et al. 2015).\nThe heat supplied varies, depending on the current, behavior of the electrodes, and the impedance level of the tissue. Energy levels supplied also directly depend on the target tissues and the rate of collagen conformation."

    "text": "How RF Pulsed Energy Changes Collagen Conformation\nHybrid skin rejuvenation strategies, as an innovative approach in cosmetic skin repair, focus on the skin’s collagen and elastic fiber matrix. By providing a biological scaffolding over the subcutaneous tissues, the integrity of this collagen network determines the firmness and elasticity of the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollagen Decline\n\n\n\nOn an average estimate, the adult skin losses about 1% of its dermal collagen composition every year (Ganceviciene et al. 2012).\n\n\nWith advanced age, this intricate collagen-elastin fiber arrangement loosens as a direct consequence of collagen degradation and an altered collagen replacement. A disrupted collagen network is physically observed as paper-like wrinkles and a slacked skin texture.\nSub-surface heating of the skin tissues distributes a burst of thermal energy through the collagen matrix. Once the collagen fibers are heated, the cross-links are disrupted. At the therapeutic thermal level, collagen fibers undergo denaturation causing the triple-helix formation to shrink and unwind. Collagen denaturation is reportedly dependent on the exposure time and the thermal energy level. As a biological response to collagen denaturation, a complex cycle of natural wound healing is initiated. Radiofrequency energy distribution in the collagen matrix ultimately induces colagenneosynthesis (Kao et al. 2013).\nThe extent of collagen denaturation, fibroblast activation, fibroplasia, and collagen reformation depends on skin type, exposure time, and thermal energy distribution. According to reported case studies, collagen shrinkage occurs to a certain depth followed by colagenneosynthesis in the superficial layers. In hybrid skin rejuvenation therapy, RF treatment also increases blood perfusion, supporting natural healing and fibroblast activity necessary for cosmetic repair."

The science supporting collagen synthesis using pulsed radio-frequency energy is a recurring theme in dermatology studies. In a 2013 publication of the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, researchers described how pulsed radio-frequency energy-treated skin defects were characterized by dermal cell proliferation and increased collagen synthesis in animal models.\nCollagen is a naturally-occurring family of proteins with over 25 types described so far in biological systems. The complex processes orchestrating collagens formation occur both extracellularly and intracellularly in the fibroblast cells.\n\n\n\nFig.3: Collagen Synthesis\n\n\nStructurally, collagen is composed of elongated fibrils wound in a triple helix of two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Several amino acid sequences including Glycine-X-Hydroxyproline and Glycine-Proline-X are found in the collagen matrix. Alpha chains form the bedrock of collagen formation. Two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 combine to form to procollagen. Extracellular modification of procollagen strands produces tropocollagen molecules. On further processing, tropocollagen molecules are covalently bonded to form collagen fibrils. Multiple collagen fibers aggregate to produce the different types of collagen fibers found in the skin (Onursal et al. 2021)."

By stimulating collagen synthesis, these devices restore the pristine nature of the skin matrix, firming its texture and reversing the visible signs of physiological aging. As thermal energy denatures the collagen fibers, heat pulse initiates collagen synthesis through the natural response to wound healing. The in vivo response to thermal wound healing constitutes the inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling stages.\nDermal health application breaks the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the collagen fibers, resulting in denaturation and immediate contraction. Further synthesis, deposition, and remodeling of new collagen fibers increase the overall collagen volume and integrity. This explains the firmness and the improved skin texture noticed almost immediately. With home-based RF energy devices, visible clinical results are achieved within the first few months of therapy."

The therapy sequence slows down physiological aging and reverses cosmetic damage by collagen decay and improved synthesis of collagen. Also, as a cheaper alternative to hospital cosmetic therapies sessions, home-based RF energy devices are gaining more recognition in cosmetic repair than level 3 in-office procedures. Conventionally, skin conditions are treated by in-person clinic appointments.\nHowever, the therapy session involves frequent clinic visits and huge financial inputs. As it stands, the trend of dermatology care is steadily shifting towards personalized cosmetic care without frequent clinic visits. Home-based RF devices fit perfectly into this space as a companion of choice and the most effective option available globally."

    "section": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nAs of January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the total number of COVID-19 infection cases as over 98 million globally. Up to the date of this review, the last weekly epidemiological report declared the total number of global death rates are over 2 million since the start of the pandemic (Sohrabi et al. 2020). Announcing COVID-19 as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the Coronavirus disease has significantly reshaped life and daily living around every corner of the world.\nIts impact on the medical practice and surgical management have been most devastating. Although the race for a treatment protocol and vaccine started earlier, healthcare providers globally felt the crushing blow of this novel viral infection. No doubt, the health dangers of delayed surgical procedures are well-defined.\nAs the reported cases of daily infection surged significantly, the need to develop and measure the variables that directly measures the impacts of COVID-19 infections on clinical procedures also developed. The data and evidence gathered from such measures were projected to guide updated reviews of medical practices as the pandemic rages on (Chen et al. 2020).\nIn health facilities with active cases of COVID-19, physicians were forced to update treatment protocols and closely monitor parameters such as drug effectiveness, surgical outcomes, and disease resolution index (Liang et al. 2020). Research teams worked in different healthcare facilities, including a COVID-19 Centre, studying the clinical outcomes of thoracic surgery in the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOur goal, with this research, is to evaluate the clinical outcomes following elective thoracic surgery –Lobectomies – in a participant pool of 93 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in non-COVID-19 and a COVID-19 center."

    "section": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "DISCUSSION\nMany research studies have highlighted the post-operative risks and outcome impacts of COVID-19 on patients undergoing surgical procedures, , while others have directly documented the morbidity scores of delayed surgical resection (Samson et al. 2015). Al-Jabir et al. (2020) carefully recommended the protocols for disinfection and surgical maneuvers for anesthesiologists and surgeons performing thoracic surgery on a patient.\nThe general index for post-operative pulmonary complications is low; however, the presence of comorbidities and viral infections can affect the diagnostic workup and surgical outcome. With reference to an earlier report (Aminian et al. 2020) confirming that undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 infection may complicate post-operative recovery. (al-jabir2020also?) also defined the modalities for post-operative care and elective ICU admissions in surgical cases with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.\nAt the time of compiling these results, the team was not aware of any similar reports exactly detailing the outcome of elective lung lobectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This report, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind globally, reconciling the parameters defining standardized patient care with the outcomes of elective surgery as affected by COVID-19 infection. Although, there are studies proposing new ideas on emergency thoracic surgery patient care irrespective of COVID-19 (Maurizi and Rendina 2020) On admission, preoperative history of comorbidities and at-risk behaviors were documented for every patient.\nAt the time of research reporting, our team was unaware of any large-scale cohort studies statistically evaluating the post-operative risks and complications of lobectomies associated with a COVID-19 infection. The only relevant studies, in this case, were published by Lei et al. (2020). Lei’s team reports statistical data on the outcomes and clinical characteristics as observed in 34 surgical cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.\nThree high-mortality thoracic surgery cases were captured; however, the majority of the surgical cases were on oncological surgeries with no patient confirmed of an active COVID-19 infection prior to surgery. The data from Wuhan suggested that the percentage of patients requiring post-operative critical care (44.1%) was higher than the general population of patients on admission with COVID-19-related health complications.\nLimited by lockdown protocols of the pandemic, our team decided to incorporate telemedicine into the standardized care plan drafted for these patients. As a safe and modern method of remote healthcare delivery, the study population was introduced to Microsoft tams and Pando –a mobile app –for pre-and post-surgical monitoring. The procedures and schedule for communication and feedback analysis from these platforms followed early protocols in remote healthcare delivery for surgical cases.\nCerfolio, Ferrari-Light, and Shah (2019) earlier described the safety and efficiency of telemedicine in delivering preoperative and post-operative clinical care to patients scheduled for thoracic surgery.  The submissions of this early research explained how the authors confirmed that telemedicine safely determines oncologic surgical resectability and patient fitness and providing outstanding outcomes in surgical care.\nOur team is aware of an earlier study exploring the prevalence of smoking rate and comorbidities in evaluating the relationship between disease severity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caliskan and Saylan (2020) concluded in this study that smoking, cardiac disease, congestive pulmonary diseases, and old age are risk factors for intensive care admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients.\nThe comorbidities and at-risk behaviors documented in our study pool include smoking [13 current smokers, 54 ex-smokers], renal failure [13], steroid therapy [4], and diabetes [2 diets controlled, 1 insulin-dependent, 10 oral therapy, and diet controlled].\nAlthough the lobectomies captured in this report were elective, patient care was directed at providing efficient clinical care in line with COVID-19 protocol guidance for triage of operations for thoracic malignancies (Antonoff et al. 2020). It is important to emphasize the integration of telemedicine using the Pando mobile app to deliver medical care during this study.\nWe believe that the zero morbidity rate recorded during this study is in part aided by utilizing technology in the postoperative and preoperative setting for patient evaluation and to triage any potential complications (Grenda, Whang, and Evans 2020). The mean length of post-surgical hospital stay recorded was also compared with pre-COVID data for the same period (March – September) in 2019. We had a significant reduction in the mean length of post-surgical hospital stay, with the 2020 value pegged at 5 as against the higher 2019 value at 7.\nOf the 93 patients observed during this study, 72 developed no primary complications, with the remaining 21 patients developing various primary complications ranging from acute post-surgical troublesome pain, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, mild gastric dilatation, persistent air leak, surgical emphysema, post-operative pneumonia, and other acute abdominal conditions requiring laparotomy.\nThe team recorded and analyzed the relationship between these complications and other variables of this study, including the mean of length of post-surgical hospital stay. The group of patients that developed other acute abdominal conditions requiring laparotomy as a primary complication stayed the longest in the hospital at a mean length of post-surgical stay of 5 days.\nPost-operative secondary complications diagnosed in the study cases were also documented.  Eighty-nine patients developed no secondary complications as supportive care for primary complications were swiftly initiated. However, one patient developed mild arrhythmia requiring no treatment other than drugs, one patient developed atelectasis (collapse), another was diagnosed with persistent air leak, and the last patient developed a case of pleural effusion of an unknown cause. We recorded no case of tertiary complications. Therapy was considered largely successful as all members of the ninety-three patient pool were discharged with no recorded of mortality.\nThe discharged destinations were different for our patients, with two patients alive and transferred to another hospital/department and ninety-one patients discharged home. None of the patients contracted the COVID-19 post-operatively and during the entire stay in the hospital. In an earlier report conducted on patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 552 hospitals in China, the overall incubation time was pegged at 4.0 days (interquartile range 2 – 7).\nThis study case stayed for more than the confirmed incubation periods and recorded no suspicious symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. Post-operative care is expected to continue with the already established COVID-19 protocol guidance for the triage of thoracic malignancy operations (Li et al. 2020)."

We achieved this feat despite working across three different COVID-19 centers. Our junior staff was actively involved in patient care protocols as they were drafted to cover the intensive care unit at these sites.\nThe result findings in this case resonate with earlier submissions on the outcomes of researches earlier conducted to evaluate the safety of patients and providers in lung cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chang et al. 2020). Effective communication using teams and Pando allowed th researchers to deliver safe patient care."

    "title": "Epidemiology of Tuberculosis: A Review (2000 - 2016)",
    "section": "Discussing Available Data Trends",
    "text": "Discussing Available Data Trends\nThe mortality rate of tuberculosis in healthy and immuno-compromised persons have triggered a global response to stem the tide of infection. In 2017, over 10 million incident cases of tuberculosis was recorded, with mortality set at 1.57 million deaths (WHO, 2018). The stats recorded showed a steadily decline in the global Tuberculosis burden as recorded in the previous year –about 1.8% decline in incident cases and 3.9% decline in global deaths due to tuberculosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout DOTS\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization introduce the DOTS strategy in 2000, until it was replaced by the Stop TB strategy in 2006.\n\n\nBoth strategies were aimed at halting and reversing tuberculosis incidence and reducing the tuberculosis prevalence and mortality by 50% by 2015. In 2016, the World Health Organization commenced a post-2015 tuberculosis strategy (End TB Strategy) aimed at ending the global tuberculosis epidemic. This new strategy was expected to cover the 2016 – 2035 TB analysis period, achieving a 35% reduction in absolute number of TB deaths and a 20% reduction in TB incidence by 2020.\n\nAs it stands, the rate of decline in incidence and death will not be enough to meet the WHO End TB strategy target for 2035. Substantial reduction in tuberculosis deaths will be necessary to meet the first installment aim by 2030.\n\nVariations in the epidemiology of TB have been consistently tracked by geographical distribution and, now by sex and age distribution. Africa constitutes one of the highest regional prevalence rate of tuberculosis. Co-infection with HIV is considered an important factor in the rate of TB epidemic in this region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA compromised immune system has been linked with increased mortality in people infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis1\n\n\nIn Asia, the data recorded by the WHO datasheet on global Tuberculosis burden show similarity to that in Africa. The incidence rate revealed a rising case of tuberculosis infection in the region. However, compared to Africa, there is a lower burden of HIV infection in this region. Other risk factors such as poverty, undernutrition, poor hygiene control in crowded spaces and lack of adequate medical care contributes to the driving force of tuberculosis infection in this region.\nIn Europe, the cluster of countries only contributes about 3% to the global incidence of tuberculosis in 2016. The burden of tuberculosis in this region tilts toward therapy failure and not risk factors that substantially increases new infections as in Africa and Asia. Multi-drug resistant TB strains (MDR TB) is considered a major problem in Europe. The proportion of MDR TB cases in this region is about 5 times higher compared with other regions, posing a major challenge in treating cases of tuberculosis.\nEnhanced strategies might be needed to combat the prevalence of TB in this region. Experts have suggested pre-testing and treatment for multi-drug resistant TB, screening for coinfection with HIV among the vulnerable groups and addressed the challenges posed by poverty and malnutrition.\nReviews on the global burden of tuberculosis opened new insights into how to better control annual incidence rate of tuberculosis in a bid to meet the target for 2035. As at 2016, an estimated one third of the global population has latent TB infection and are at direct risk for a secondary infection that can significantly increases future risk for TB3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the WHO recognized this problem and released an updated guideline for the management of Latent TB.\n\n\nThis therapy guideline was slowly implemented in many countries and current data suggest that the coverage level falls below the End TB strategy target for 2025. Treatment of latent TB can directly impact the incidence and prevalence rate recorded for tuberculosis infections globally in subsequent years\nThe World Health Organization and regional health bodies continuously examine and optimized the Stop TB strategies as it applies in their regions. Many scientific reviews have called for regional annual reports on incidence and mortality to better estimate the improvement in the global TB burden. This can also help for objective assessment of the WHO data sheet on tuberculosis annually and to track improvement in epidemic control.\nThe data sheet on Tuberculosis presented by WHO in 2016, was reportedly based on direct reflections from national surveys on tuberculosis by 24 countries. This accounts for 68% of the global burden of this infection. Standard adjustments on data allow for underreporting or under-diagnosing for 134 countries constituting 15% of the global TB burden.\nDuring the period tracked in this paper, the estimation of death caused by tuberculosis was based on national registration of cases of death for 129 countries constituting 57% of the estimated tuberculosis death globally. WHO also used estimates produced by the Institute of Health Metrics to estimate tuberculosis death in 18 countries. Currently, the epidemiologic estimates only show modest improvement in the global TB burden, as determined by steadily declining incidence, mortality and prevalence rate, pegged at an average of 1.4% annually. Intensified and concerted effort are needed to meet the targets set for 2035 and beyond.\nInnovative approaches and modification of the strategy guidelines are required in regions with a significant annual burden of tuberculosis. These include pre-screening for HIV co-infection, implementation of latent TB therapy guidelines, innovative TB therapy regimen and ensuring hygiene in clustered regions, especially in Africa and Asia. These strategies are tipped to significantly decreases the global burden of TB in subsequent years."

The problem of alcohol-related vices is a real puzzle in many parts of the world. The numbers are scary and the socioeconomic effects are, to a large extent, damaging.\nThe United States Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that almost 30 people die daily in drunk-driving crashes – one person every 50 minutes.\nAs a result, the annual cost of alcohol-related crashes has been estimated to be more than $44 billion. In 2018, an estimated 1 million drivers were arrested for alcohol-related driving offences (Barry, Schumacher, and Sauber-Schatz 2021).\nAn earlier report published in 2016 indicated that alcohol-related risky behavior is directly responsible for about 28 percent of the total traffic-related deaths in the United States. Also, about 17 percent of all traffic-related child deaths involved an alcohol-impaired driver (Teutsch, Geller, and Negussie 2018).\nThese numbers lend credence to many reports projecting alcohol-related causes as the third leading cause of death in the United States."

The rates are lowest in Africa (8%), Asia Pacific (7.3%) and the Middle East (2.4%).\nIn Vietnam –a country of over 90 million people, an annual estimation of over 4,000 road traffic deaths have been linked with alcohol-related road offences. In 2018, China reportedly recorded over 700,000 alcohol-related deaths.

    "section": "Legislation on Legal Limits of Blood Alcohol Levels",
    "text": "Legislation on Legal Limits of Blood Alcohol Levels\nThere are many legislations enacted in different regions of the world to control alcohol consumption rates. These legislations prescribe a legal volume of alcohol in the blood, and above this limit, violators may be charged at different instances for driving under the influence.\nIn part, these legislations also prescribe recommended tests for determining the concentration of alcohol in the blood. The Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) indices measures the actual grams of alcohol per 100ml of a body fluid, usually the blood.\nOn consumption, ethanol is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tracts. Depending of biological factors including gastric emptying rate and changes in gastric motility, approximately 20 percent of the total volume consumed is absorbed by passive diffusion into the bloodstream. \nSubsequently, a large chunk of the alcohol consumed is absorbed in the proximal portion of the small intestine. Ethanol is optimally soluble in water and has a low molecular weight. As a result, the alcohol concentration in the blood can noticeably changes after a few minutes of consuming a few units of alcohol.\nIn standard measurement, about 12 ounces of an alcoholic beer (approximately 5% alcohol) or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (approximately 12% alcohol) can contain as much as 14 grams of pure alcohol.\nIn the United States, it is illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL) of blood –or greater. At this concentration, drivers and operators of heavy machinery are considered legally intoxicated and the risk of alcohol-induced accidents significantly increases (Fell 2019)."

    "text": "Advanced Technological Innovations in Alcohol Monitoring Systems\nForensic investigation after a crash requires a report on the blood concentration of the driver, if a DUI is suspected. In a bid to measure the exact BAC indices, many scientific studies have proposed futuristic innovations in alcohol monitoring systems.\nThe new methods proposed –although some are theoretical –are considered more effective in measuring the exact blood level of alcohol in split intervals since consumption.\nBeyond simply curbing theviolation of alcohol rules, Alcohol Monitoring Technologies are becoming increasingly important in clinical studies and self-monitoring of blood alcohol content.\nThe futuristic technologies in Blood Alcohol Monitoring Systems include:\n\n\n\nNear Field Communication (NFC)-enabled Implantable Glucose Monitoring Systems\n\nOn-the-spot monitoring systems are increasingly becoming important in not only the clinical management of alcohol-related substance disorders, but also in monitoring alcohol levels for forensic and legal purposes. Near Field Communication tags are advanced monitoring systems enabling electronic devices to execute non-contact data transmissions over a short distance.\nThe application of this short-range high frequency technology is novel in human medicine. Until now, only a few research reviews have documented the use of NFC tags in Alcohol Monitoring Systems. The reference paper on a NFC-enabled implantable glucose monitoring system was presented in 2016 at the International Conference of Biomedical Health Information (Anabtawi, Freeman, and Ferzli 2016).\nThe futuristic glucose level monitoring system is designed as a fully implantable, battery-assisted passive continuous glucose monitoring system. With a framework integrating an amperometric glucose sensor, a NFC tag wireless front-end and digital power management unit, devices built on this system are expected to sense the level of glucose in biological system and generate an on-the-spot reproducible data.\nThe glucose sensors unit are designed with a working reference, mini electrodes and counter electrodes. Futuristic modifications of this system in alcohol monitoring have been proposed.\nAlcohol monitoring devices designed with this technology can effectively measure alcohol levels in body fluids as an implantable device. A study published by the Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research earlier demonstrated the utility of Alcohol Monitoring Systems to measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) as a means to objectively quantify drinking (Roache et al. 2015).\nResearch data concluded that positive Transdermal Alcohol Concentration readings can detect low-level drinking in all participants who had earlier consumed at least 2 standard alcohol servings. Transdermal Alcohol Monitoring using an implantable NFC-enabled alcohol sensor has proven beyond theoretical doubts to be sensitive, specific, accurate and effective.\n\n\n\nFreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System\n\nThis Continuous Glucose Monitoring System was officially approved in September 2016 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Designed for use in the professional monitoring of glucose level in interstitial fluid, this system is based on a subcutaneous, wired enzyme glucose sensing technology.\nModifications to this system have been proposed in the long-term tracking of alcohol levels in people convicted or DUI offences or under investigation for an alcohol-related risky behavior.\nIn a standard pack, the FreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System comes with a disposable sensor, a reader and a power adapter. The sensor is worn on the back of the subject’s arm and can last for 10 days (Nguyen and White 2022).\nThis device automatically measures glucose level every minute, generating a set of reading batches stored in a 15-minute interval. The reader is held close to the sensor once a glucose reading is required.\nThe data set generated displays the glucose level record for the past 8 hours. Data generated are detailed in measurement, revealing values for the direction and velocity of a subject’s glucose levels. Compared to a handheld Breathalizer, a modification of this system for alcohol level readings can provide data readings for a subject’s blood alcohol concentration over a long period of time.\n\n\nEtG Ethyl Glucuronide (ETG) Test\n\nFuturistic plans in the Alcohol Monitoring System have been expanded to capture the assay of alcohol biomarkers in the body fluid. Ethyl glucuronide is a direct, minor metabolite of ethanol. Primarily, ETG levels is explored in human physiology as a complementary parameter in immunochemical screenings the urine drug tests.\nAlthough ETG levels are detected using samples of urine, this alcohol biochemical can also be found in serum, hair and oral fluids. Once alcohol is consumed, the level of ETG detectable in urine noticeably changes.\nETG levels are normally lower in the blood, prompting researchers to prefer detection in urine. Currently, the application of ETG tests in Alcohol Monitoring Systems are mainly for confirmatory purposes.\nIn addition, the set up for ETG detection is done on a large scale using LC-MS bioassay techniques. Futuristic adaptations of alcohol monitoring devices exploring ETG levels in urine are expected to be designed as portable, wearable technologies.\nSince alcohol metabolism occurs until the last drop is excreted, these devices can provide a digital record of the levels of alcohol I the body fluids over a specific time interval. An early review, the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence published a study confirming the sensitivity of ETG tests in detecting light and heavy drinking in alcohol dependent outpatients (McDonell et al. 2015).\n\n\nBACtrack Skyn\n\nAlcohol Monitoring Systems featuring a compact design and a smartphone integration interface is definitely an advanced technological improvement on the currently available systems. The BACtract Skyn is a new generation, wrist-worn, compact transdermal alcohol biosensor.\nAs a wearable biosensor, BACtract Skyn can directly measure blood alcohol levels via the skin. BACtract Skyn and future adaptations of tis devices are expected to run on electrochemical detection strategies in the detection of alcohol in body fluids (Gunn et al. 2023).\nThe design leverages the direct oxidation of ethanol at non-enzymatic catalytic electrodes. Electrochemical reactions at the electrodes recognizes and measures alcohol metabolites excreted through the dermal pores, quantify alcohol levels in reference to a pre-calibrated standard, produce a detectable signal and a reproducible digital value of alcohol concentration.  \n\n\nWearable Enzymatic Alcohol Biosensor\n\nThis new class of alcohol level monitoring devices are designed to improve on the technical challenges of the wearable and implantable alcohol monitoring devices. Currently, the designs for this new class of devices are theoretical, still requiring many years of research for actual hardware productions.\nThe wearable enzymatic alcohol biosensors will feature an alcohol metabolizing enzyme –preferably Alcohol Oxidase, an electrochemical sensor, a power pack and a digital meter. Alcohol metabolites in the body fluids are oxidized by the enzyme (Lansdorp et al. 2019).\nThe resulting products of oxidation are sensed by the sensor. The readings provided by the digital meter directly revels the concentration of alcohol present in the body fluid. The fusion of enzymatic reaction pathways with an electrochemical detection method is a futuristic input in alcohol monitoring programs."

    "text": "The medicinal benefits of cannabis and cannabis-derived products have been known for years. At a time when no sufficient scientific evidence exists for its use, cannabis was used as self-prescribed natural products for the treatment of pain, dementia, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders(Wang et al. 2023).\nWith time, reports of debilitating adverse effects including addiction, psychosis and cognitive impairment in known long-term users emerged. As natural product science evolved, researchers extracted and studied the component compounds of the cannabis plant.\nThese researches concluded that cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid showing potential therapeutic benefits in animal models and human test subjects. As expected, the focus of enquiry on the Cannabis sativa plant shifted towards cannabidiol (Sholler, Schoene, and Spindle 2020).\nIntegrated healthcare providers reported some impressive reports on the pharmacological benefits of CBD and advised that this compound be integrated into modern medicine. Today, the term ‘Medical cannabis’ in a large part refers to cannabidiol.\nAt first, CBD was only allowed for use as an adjunctive treatment in the management of rare and chronic conditions with no standard therapy plan exists. Clinical trials were also conducted to further understand the pharmacology of this compound.\nOn June 25, 2018, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered the available clinical trial results available for Epidiolex and subsequently approved an oral solution of the drug. Epidiolex was approved for the treatment of seizures associated Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet Syndrome (Corroon and Kight 2018).\nEpidiolex became the first FDA-approved cannabidiol-based drug for use in adults and children older than 2 years. As expected, many independent research enquiries were conducted to ascertain the efficacy and safety of the new drug in the target population. Since its approval, Epidolex has shown impressive results in the treatment of the two rare forms of epilepsy for which it was indicated (Abu-Sawwa, Scutt, and Park 2020).\nTo a large extent, the approval of Epidiolex started the much publicized green rush and also created positive promotional headlines for cannabis and cannabis-derived products. For the first time, modern medicine turned to a cannabis-derived product for succor and considered other cannabis-derived products as a potential game changer in human medicine."

In the first quarter of 2020, Epidiolex sales in the United States alone was valued at $106.1 million. During this period, Epidiolex sales in Germany and U.K totaled $10 million.\n\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals has also completed plans to introduce the CBD-based drug to Sweden and Italy after a successful entry into France. Despite the Coronavirus pandemic, the global sale of Epidiolex kept increasing .\nGW Pharmaceuticals has also filed a supplemental New Drug Application with the FDA in a bid to secure approval for Epidiolex in the treatment of seizures with tuberous sclerosis complex. As an expected ripple effect, Epidiolex has spiked investment interests in other cannabis stocks globally (Thiele et al. 2021)."

In the United States alone, an estimated 1 million children experience forms of non-physical hostile treatment, abuse and neglect (Hillis et al. 2016).\nResearch estimates submits that nearly 5 million children across the globe are have been forcibly displaced and compelled to migrate across state or international boundaries, by war, torture or abuse (Martin 2017).\nA large percentage of these children contribute to the refugee crisis in many developed countries. Children and young adults also make up more than 2% of all detected trafficking victims globally. In regions where the stats describing child abuse and neglect are high, there is an accompanying breakdown in the societal construct, law and order.\nThis has inspired many behavioral researchers to investigate how youthful/childhood experiences of abuse and neglect affect lifestyle at later stages of life.

Adults who experienced neglect and abuse at a younger age are also most likely to exhibit fear, anger, withdrawal and avoidance (Lippard and Nemeroff 2020).\nThey also display unruly behavior and have high rates of conduct problems, interaction problems and substance use problems.\n\n\nPsychosocial Consequences\n\nSevere neglect at childhood have been shown to adversely affect psychosocial wellbeing at later stages of life. These psychosocial consequences have been observed to manifest as attention deficits, poor social skills, developmental delays, emotional delays and indulgence in illicit drug use.\nYoung adults experiencing psychosocial consequences earlier also shows indications of diminished self-esteem, deteriorating social functioning and a heightened level of depression (Masselink, Van Roekel, and Oldehinkel 2017). This explains why psychiatric diagnosis and affective disorders are common among young adults who fall in this category.\nSignificant emotional difficulties, inappropriate sexual behaviors, an affiliation to antisocial gangs are also widely documented among this population. There are also many forms of medical, physiological and cognitive consequences experienced at adulthood and linked with child abuse and neglect."

    "text": "Research Evidences Linking Child Abuse and Neglect with Substance Use Disorders at Adulthood\nYoung adults who experienced moderate and severe forms of abuse and neglect during childhood have long been considered a vulnerable population to alcohol problems and illicit drug use. However, until recently, these considerations were largely unproven. Currently, there are numerous scientific enquiries establishing a link between abuse and neglect at childhood and substance use disorders at late stages of adulthood.\nOne of the earliest studies on this relationship was published by Wilsnack and colleagues in 1997. The researchers assessed the relationship between child abuse and adult drinking behavior in 1,099 women participating in a 190-year national survey on women’s drinking.\nCases of abuse were reported retrospectively by the participants. The research results suggest that women who had experience forms if abuse and neglect during childhood were significantly likely to have alcohol-related behaviors and problems.\nIn 2013, the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs published a research conducted to examine possible links childhood maltreatment and alcohol use disorders. The participant poll was made of 4,468 people within the age range of 18-25, participating in the National Epidemiology Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.\nAfter adjusting sociodemographic characteristics, the authors concluded that childhood maltreatment was associated with greater likelihood of an alcohol use disorder. Most importantly, difference in age prevalence of alcohol use disorders among the participants who reported multiple types of maltreatment and physical abuse was significant in the older age groups.\nMany research studies have covered more than alcohol-related risky behaviors on this subject. A research report published by the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence examined how Substance misuse problems are exhibited as coping motive for childhood abuse in South African adolescents attending school.\nThis research was designed as a secondary analysis of 1,149 adolescents attending schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Childhood trauma, alcohol and drug problems and coping orientation were measured with Questionnaires.\nResearch results suggested that drug use –as a coping mechanism –mediates the relationship between three forms of child abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) and substance use problems in adolescents (Hogarth, Martin, and Seedat 2019).\nMany other researches have documented and established a link between reported cases of childhood abuse and substance use problems in later stages of life. The common theme in these researches indicates that childhood problems of abuse and neglect significantly predispose adults to substance use disorders.\nBy extension, it is safe to conclude that adults currently suffering from alcohol use disorders and illicit drug addiction might have a positive history of abuse and neglect."

    "text": "Risk Factors Influencing the Link Between Childhood Abuse and Substance Use Problems in Adulthood\nWhy exactly are substance use problems in adulthood the predominant social observation related to child abuse and neglect? This question has prompted various researchers to examine why these adults choose this response over others. The arguments explaining this observation so far are numerous.\nMany researchers agree that people who experienced neglect and forms of abuse as teenagers use alcohol and illicit drugs as a coping mechanism (Min et al. 2007). Repeated cases of childhood abuse and neglect leads to social withdrawal and depression. People who lack a proper coping mechanism engage in alcohol and drug abuse as a means to seek consolation.\nAlcohol and illicit drugs are not indicated for these social problems and as such, cannot solve them. These individuals simply engage in repeated use of these products, leading to dependence.\nAntisocial behaviors have long been linked with childhood cases of abuse and neglect. These behaviors, captured many times as aggression, violence, delinquency and hyperactivity, are widely considered as consequences of childhood victimization, abuse and neglect.\nOn reaching a stage of external socialization, people exhibiting these behaviors fits perfectly in a deviant group of others exhibiting same. These peer groups of delinquents hold oppositional and antisocial views that promotes alcohol and illicit drug use. The repeated circle of group influence leads to alcohol and illicit drug use and dependence among the individuals of these groups.\nPost-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in in victims of childhood abuse and neglect have also been described as an influencing factor for alcohol and drug dependence. There are many research reports suggesting that the prevalence of alcohol problems is likely higher in adults with a positive history of abuse and neglect and has experienced PTSD (Cross et al. 2015).\nThese researches implicates PTSD as factor that increases the incidence of substance misuse as coping mechanism for childhood experiences of abuse."

For many women, these changes mean a lot and influence the quality of life as menopause starts.\nMenopausal age vary significantly across a population. Many times, it depends on genetics, race, socioeconomic status, number of ovulations, age at menarche, environmental factors, exposure to chemicals and toxins, and the presence of any medical conditions affecting the reproductive system. These factors constitute huge differences and unpredictability in the menopausal experiences across populations (n.d.a)."

    "section": "The Physiology of Menopause",
    "text": "The Physiology of Menopause\nPrimarily, menopause results from a complete loss of ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropin stimulations. These decreased sensitivities are directly involved in follicular attrition. The oocytes (the female gamete cells called ‘the egg’) in the ovaries undergo raid degeneration and eventual loss of reproductive ability (n.d.b).\nAs expected, the rapid degeneration of these oocytes results in a decline in the quantity and quality of ovarian follicles. So, when menopause happens, the reproductive system is healthy, but the follicles are shrinking and the reproductive ability is eventually lost. \nAs follicles age and shrink in size, resistance to gonadotropin reduces consistently, and the circulating levels of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) increase. The increased circulating levels prompt the stromal stimulation of the ovary, causing a decrease in estradiol levels, inhibin levels, and an increase in estrone levels (n.d.c).\nThe estradiol decrease is more dramatic as the decline rate climbs significantly within 4 years. As ovulation stops, the production from the conversion of androgens in the ovarian stroma and the production of estrogen in extra-gonadal sites remain unaffected. The adipose tissues, muscles, liver, bone, bone marrow, and hair roots represent a huge source of estrogen during this phase of a woman’s life.\nExposure to estrogen from non-ovarian sites also comes with its effects –it increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in menopausal women. The complete hormonal interplay during this stage of life is numerous and very complex to cover within the scope of this review."

    "text": "Thyroid Functions At Menopause\nNo doubt, menopause is a process of complex hormonal regulations. With every volume of gonadal hormones and other markers of reproductive function, a complex system of hormonal regulation explains the physiology of menopause.\nWomen spend one-third of their lifetime in menopause, combating the symptoms associated with this stage and its occasional fluctuations in hormonal levels. Therapy methods that explore balancing these hormones have long been proposed, modified, and practiced in human medicine. Hormone replacement therapy is commonly recommended in postmenopausal women.\nThe function of the thyroid hormone in menopause is an interesting topic in women’s health. Dysfunctions of the thyroid predominantly affect women with an incidence of 20 times greater than men. The incidence of these thyroid dysfunctions also increases with increasing age (n.d.d).\nSince the average age of menopause is pegged at 50, regular thyroid screenings are recommended for menopausal women. Clinical survey results showed that nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and thyroid gland autoimmunity are well reported in menopausal women.\nIt is sometimes difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disease in menopausal women as the symptoms for both cessation of ovulation (menopause) and thyroid dysfunctions in these women are common. Understanding how the thyroid affects hormonal regulation at menopause can help with therapy options for managing the symptoms a woman experiences at menopause."

    "text": "Researches Linking Thyroid Hormone Function and Menopause\nMany studies suggest that estrogen has a direct effect on the human thyroid cells. These interactions are studied extensively during menopause as the thyroid also ages. Earlier reports on this interaction have shown how estrogen increases the thyroxine-binding globulin and how thyroid hormone is needed in hypothyroid women undergoing estrogen therapy (n.d.e).\nThe molecular interaction between estrogen and thyroid hormones is mediated by the estrogen receptors. In the body, the cellular action of estrogen –a lipophilic molecule, is medicated by its binding with two nuclear receptors –estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, and ER-beta. In any cells where these receptors are found, estrogen can affect a cellular change with receptor to receptor binding. This is how the estrogen-thyroid hormone relationship works during menopause (n.d.f).\nEstrogen receptors (ERs) have been described in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic human thyroid tissues. However, these studies are relatively new, and their evidence is still under investigation. Some chemical assay studies have discovered ER-positivity in both normal and abnormal thyroid tissues.\nToday, both estrogen receptor variants have been reportedly discovered in thyroid tissues with many researchers currently examining how these receptors mediate thyroid functions during menopause. For now, the working assumption is that estrogen binding to ER-alpha promotes cell proliferation and growth while estrogen binding to ER-beta promotes apoptotic actions.\nThyroid hormone dysfunctions are especially frequent in postmenopausal women. With these dysfunctions come different signs and symptoms that make menopause a terrible experience for some women. These undesired symptoms have been linked to an aging thyroid function (n.d.g).\nAs women age, thyroid functioning declines Morphological studies have revealed that the thyroid epithelium degenerates, leading to its flattening and a resultant reduction in the size of the thyroid follicles. In many women, fibrous connective tissues and lymphoid tissues may replace a part of the previously healthy thyroid gland.\nThe ability of the thyroid gland to uptake dietary iodine and produce its hormones during this period diminishes. The statistics are worrying. The iodine-uptake ability of the thyroid in people over 80 years old becomes 40 percent lower than in people over 30 years. The daily production of T4 –the main thyroid gland also decreases per microgram with biological metabolism slowing down significantly (n.d.h).   \nAs menopause progresses, the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction increases in women. An early study –the Whickham Survey, provided statistical justification for this. This study discovered that the incidence of elevated Thyroid-stimulating hormone is about 7.6% in the general female population and 17% in women over 70 years of age.\nThe risk for developing hypothyroidism in women 75 -80 years of age is pegged at 14/1000/year. In another study –the Colorado Survey, the incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to be about 4 percent in women aged 25 years. This value rises to about 14 and 20 percent for women aged 55 and 75 respectively (n.d.i).\nThis study further establishes the point that thyroid hormone functioning is very important in menopause. If the thyroid dysfunctional during this period, the signs and symptoms that follow can make menopause a terrible experience for any woman out there."

    "text": "Navigating Menopause\nGlobally, about 1.5 million women experience the transition to menopause every year. Many of these women often report cases of undesired symptoms including vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, insomnia, and joint pain. If not properly managed, these symptoms can make menopause a very terrible experience. The most commonly reported symptoms of menopause include:\n\n\nVasomotor Symptoms\n\nVasomotor symptoms during menopause are often reported as hot flashes. About 85% of menopausal women report hot flashes of variable severity, frequency, and duration. Hot flashes can also be present in about 55% of women at the perimenopause stage (n.d.j).\nThere are some racial and ethnic variations to this experience as Caucasian women reported the highest prevalence and Japanese and Chinese women reports the lowest. It is a feeling of intense warmth presenting with sweating, flushing, and chills. The physiological events that occur during hot flashes have been linked with different biological responses to hormonal fluctuations at menopause.\nThese includes elevated skin blood flow –suggesting peripheral vasodilation with temperature spikes occurring in the digits, face, arm, back, legs, chest, and abdomen. Measures of sweating and skin conductance also increase during these episodes.\nMost importantly, core body temperature increases before hot flashes. The increase in core body temperature is caused by increased metabolic rate and the peripheral vasodilation that follows. Many studies have also related the cause of hot flashes to variabilities in the levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid hormones in menopausal women.\nRegardless of the contributing mechanisms, it is evident that both hormone therapy and non-hormonal therapy can help relieve hot flashes in these women.\n\n\nVulvovaginal Atrophy\n\nVulvovaginal atrophy presents as vaginal dryness, dysuria, urinary urgency, and dyspareunia. The physiology of urogenital atrophy in menopausal women has long been described. The fluctuations in estrogen levels during perimenopause and the sustained low levels of this hormone during menopause render the reproductive tissues fragile (n.d.k).\nhe fragile tissues are distressed, leading to the multiple vulvovaginal symptoms experienced at menopause. In addition to tissue distress, there can be vaginal atrophy, narrowing, and shortening of the vagina, and uterine prolapse. The urinary tracts have estrogen receptors, and as the fluctuations in estrogen levels continue the risk of urinary tract infections increases.\nUnlike hot flashes, the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy do not improve over time without treatment.\n\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nAs aging progresses, sleep quality generally deteriorates. With menopause, the decrease in sleep quality becomes more noticeable. A 2015 study published by Menopause evaluated the patterns in actigraphy-defined sleep measures of sleep and movements across the menstrual cycle in midlife menstruating women. Results from this study suggest that women report trouble sleeping during peri-menopause and sleep quality worsens at menopause (n.d.l).\nStudies have also suggested that as much as 25 minutes of quality sleep per night can be lost by women during their late reproductive years. Compromise in sleep quality at menopause has been linked with hormonal changes.\nMany times, the sleep disorders reported by menopausal women can be hard to categorize. These sleep difficulties are often complicated by mood disorders associated with menopause and poor sleep hygiene habits. It is common for these women to report nighttime awakenings, night sweats, and short sleep duration.\nThey may also experience difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep and early awakenings.  Insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome are the commonly identified sleep disorders in menopausal women. The clinical burden of menopause-induced sleep disorders can be very huge. These women experience daytime fatigue, sleepiness, generalized body weakness, and restlessness.\n\n\nDepression and Adverse Mood\n\nHormonal fluctuation during menopause has a bearing on mood. In its 157th annual general meeting, the American Psychiatric Association delivered an update on the risk factors and treatment approaches for perimenopause-related mood disturbances. This update suggested that an estimated 20% of women transitioning to menopause have depression at some point (n.d.m).\nClinical studies have suggested that mood disorders are more noticeable at menopause and less during postmenopausal years. Menopausal-related depression is caused by fluctuations and a reduction in estrogen levels. Estrogen and steroid hormones are known to stimulate the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.\nEstrogen also increases the effects of serotonin and norepinephrine –hormones considered to be involved in the physiology of depression. The strongest risk factor of depression in these menopausal women is a prior history of depression, with consistent variabilities in the levels of reproductive and menopause regulatory hormones (n.d.n).\nOther risk factors identified so far include poor sleep, high body mass index, low socioeconomic class, and race. Other menopausal symptoms commonly reported include osteoporosis and changes in cognitive function."

In addition to reducing life quality during menopause, these menopausal symptoms make menopause a terrible experience for many women. Treating these symptoms is a big topic in human medicine. Hormone replacement therapy has long been used in reducing the effects of these symptoms.\nHowever, there have been many controversies surrounding this therapy option. Except that it is contraindicated in many women, there are also many studies linking it with cancer, stroke, cognitive decline, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular diseases.\nOptimizing the thyroid and another hormonal complex regulating the events at menopause has been proposed as a viable approach to managing these symptoms. Supplying the body with enough dietary iodine is a cheap and clinically friendly way of optimizing thyroid health. On average, the Recommended Daily Allowance of iodine for menopausal women is 150 micrograms per day (n.d.o).\nThis micronutrient is primarily needed by the thyroid gland for the production of thyroid hormones. Menopausal syndromes have been linked with thyroid dysfunctions and a decline in thyroid hormone levels. Improving thyroid functioning with iodine supplements can help manage these symptoms better in women.\nSeafood is the largest reservoir of dietary iodine on earth. Consuming seafood can give the body a moderate quantity of iodine for optimizing thyroid health (n.d.p). Menopausal women who are vegans or do not use iodized salts are at a greater risk of these symptoms. Vegans’ meals contain no iodine, making it hard for menopausal women who are vegans to have a healthy thyroid as they age.\nMany women may also choose to get their daily iodine portions to form iodine supplements. Iodine products formulated for menopausal women supply 12.5mg of iodine to the body. At this quantity, the recommended daily iodine intake requirements are met and the thyroid gland has a good reservoir of dietary iodine."

In 2018, an estimated 1 million drivers were arrested for alcohol-related driving offences (Barry, Schumacher, and Sauber-Schatz 2021).\nAn earlier report published in 2016 indicated that alcohol-related risky behavior is directly responsible for about 28 percent of the total traffic-related deaths in the United States. Also, about 17 percent of all traffic-related child deaths involved an alcohol-impaired driver (Teutsch, Geller, and Negussie 2018).\nThese numbers lend credence to many reports projecting alcohol-related causes as the third leading cause of death in the United States."

    "text": "Legislation on Legal Limits of Blood Alcohol Levels\nThere are many legislations enacted in different regions of the world to control alcohol consumption rates. These legislations prescribe a legal volume of alcohol in the blood, and above this limit, violators may be charged at different instances for driving under the influence.\nIn part, these legislations also prescribe recommended tests for determining the concentration of alcohol in the blood. The Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) indices measures the actual grams of alcohol per 100ml of a body fluid, usually the blood.\nOn consumption, ethanol is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tracts. Depending of biological factors including gastric emptying rate and changes in gastric motility, approximately 20 percent of the total volume consumed is absorbed by passive diffusion into the bloodstream. \nSubsequently, a large chunk of the alcohol consumed is absorbed in the proximal portion of the small intestine. Ethanol is optimally soluble in water and has a low molecular weight. As a result, the alcohol concentration in the blood can noticeably changes after a few minutes of consuming a few units of alcohol.\nIn standard measurement, about 12 ounces of an alcoholic beer (approximately 5% alcohol) or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (approximately 12% alcohol) can contain as much as 14 grams of pure alcohol.\nIn the United States, it is illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL) of blood –or greater. At this concentration, drivers and operators of heavy machinery are considered legally intoxicated and the risk of alcohol-induced accidents significantly increases (Fell 2019)."

    "text": "Advanced Technological Innovations in Alcohol Monitoring Systems\nForensic investigation after a crash requires a report on the blood concentration of the driver, if a DUI is suspected. In a bid to measure the exact BAC indices, many scientific studies have proposed futuristic innovations in alcohol monitoring systems.\nThe new methods proposed –although some are theoretical –are considered more effective in measuring the exact blood level of alcohol in split intervals since consumption.\nBeyond simply curbing theviolation of alcohol rules, Alcohol Monitoring Technologies are becoming increasingly important in clinical studies and self-monitoring of blood alcohol content.\nThe futuristic technologies in Blood Alcohol Monitoring Systems include:\n\n\n\nNear Field Communication (NFC)-enabled Implantable Glucose Monitoring Systems\n\nOn-the-spot monitoring systems are increasingly becoming important in not only the clinical management of alcohol-related substance disorders, but also in monitoring alcohol levels for forensic and legal purposes. Near Field Communication tags are advanced monitoring systems enabling electronic devices to execute non-contact data transmissions over a short distance.\nThe application of this short-range high frequency technology is novel in human medicine. Until now, only a few research reviews have documented the use of NFC tags in Alcohol Monitoring Systems. The reference paper on a NFC-enabled implantable glucose monitoring system was presented in 2016 at the International Conference of Biomedical Health Information (Anabtawi, Freeman, and Ferzli 2016).\nThe futuristic glucose level monitoring system is designed as a fully implantable, battery-assisted passive continuous glucose monitoring system. With a framework integrating an amperometric glucose sensor, a NFC tag wireless front-end and digital power management unit, devices built on this system are expected to sense the level of glucose in biological system and generate an on-the-spot reproducible data.\nThe glucose sensors unit are designed with a working reference, mini electrodes and counter electrodes. Futuristic modifications of this system in alcohol monitoring have been proposed.\nAlcohol monitoring devices designed with this technology can effectively measure alcohol levels in body fluids as an implantable device. A study published by the Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research earlier demonstrated the utility of Alcohol Monitoring Systems to measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) as a means to objectively quantify drinking (Roache et al. 2015).\nResearch data concluded that positive Transdermal Alcohol Concentration readings can detect low-level drinking in all participants who had earlier consumed at least 2 standard alcohol servings. Transdermal Alcohol Monitoring using an implantable NFC-enabled alcohol sensor has proven beyond theoretical doubts to be sensitive, specific, accurate and effective.\n\n\n\nFreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System\n\nThis Continuous Glucose Monitoring System was officially approved in September 2016 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Designed for use in the professional monitoring of glucose level in interstitial fluid, this system is based on a subcutaneous, wired enzyme glucose sensing technology.\nModifications to this system have been proposed in the long-term tracking of alcohol levels in people convicted or DUI offences or under investigation for an alcohol-related risky behavior.\nIn a standard pack, the FreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System comes with a disposable sensor, a reader and a power adapter. The sensor is worn on the back of the subject’s arm and can last for 10 days (Nguyen and White 2022).\nThis device automatically measures glucose level every minute, generating a set of reading batches stored in a 15-minute interval. The reader is held close to the sensor once a glucose reading is required.\nThe data set generated displays the glucose level record for the past 8 hours. Data generated are detailed in measurement, revealing values for the direction and velocity of a subject’s glucose levels. Compared to a handheld Breathalizer, a modification of this system for alcohol level readings can provide data readings for a subject’s blood alcohol concentration over a long period of time.\n\n\nEtG Ethyl Glucuronide (ETG) Test\n\nFuturistic plans in the Alcohol Monitoring System have been expanded to capture the assay of alcohol biomarkers in the body fluid. Ethyl glucuronide is a direct, minor metabolite of ethanol. Primarily, ETG levels is explored in human physiology as a complementary parameter in immunochemical screenings the urine drug tests.\nAlthough ETG levels are detected using samples of urine, this alcohol biochemical can also be found in serum, hair and oral fluids. Once alcohol is consumed, the level of ETG detectable in urine noticeably changes.\nETG levels are normally lower in the blood, prompting researchers to prefer detection in urine. Currently, the application of ETG tests in Alcohol Monitoring Systems are mainly for confirmatory purposes.\nIn addition, the set up for ETG detection is done on a large scale using LC-MS bioassay techniques. Futuristic adaptations of alcohol monitoring devices exploring ETG levels in urine are expected to be designed as portable, wearable technologies.\nSince alcohol metabolism occurs until the last drop is excreted, these devices can provide a digital record of the levels of alcohol I the body fluids over a specific time interval. An early review, the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence published a study confirming the sensitivity of ETG tests in detecting light and heavy drinking in alcohol dependent outpatients (McDonell et al. 2015).\n\n\nBACtrack Skyn\n\nAlcohol Monitoring Systems featuring a compact design and a smartphone integration interface is definitely an advanced technological improvement on the currently available systems. The BACtract Skyn is a new generation, wrist-worn, compact transdermal alcohol biosensor.\nAs a wearable biosensor, BACtract Skyn can directly measure blood alcohol levels via the skin. BACtract Skyn and future adaptations of tis devices are expected to run on electrochemical detection strategies in the detection of alcohol in body fluids (Gunn et al. 2023).\nThe design leverages the direct oxidation of ethanol at non-enzymatic catalytic electrodes. Electrochemical reactions at the electrodes recognizes and measures alcohol metabolites excreted through the dermal pores, quantify alcohol levels in reference to a pre-calibrated standard, produce a detectable signal and a reproducible digital value of alcohol concentration.  \n\n\nWearable Enzymatic Alcohol Biosensor\n\nThis new class of alcohol level monitoring devices are designed to improve on the technical challenges of the wearable and implantable alcohol monitoring devices. Currently, the designs for this new class of devices are theoretical, still requiring many years of research for actual hardware productions.\nThe wearable enzymatic alcohol biosensors will feature an alcohol metabolizing enzyme –preferably Alcohol Oxidase, an electrochemical sensor, a power pack and a digital meter. Alcohol metabolites in the body fluids are oxidized by the enzyme (Lansdorp et al. 2019).\nThe resulting products of oxidation are sensed by the sensor. The readings provided by the digital meter directly revels the concentration of alcohol present in the body fluid. The fusion of enzymatic reaction pathways with an electrochemical detection method is a futuristic input in alcohol monitoring programs."

    "text": "Global Stats on Child Abuse and Neglect\nThese forms of child abuse and neglect are recorded in almost every social setting around the globe. In 2014, a global estimate of 1 billion children between the ages of 2-17 reportedly experienced forms of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. In the United States alone, an estimated 1 million children experience forms of non-physical hostile treatment, abuse and neglect (Hillis et al. 2016).\nResearch estimates submits that nearly 5 million children across the globe are have been forcibly displaced and compelled to migrate across state or international boundaries, by war, torture or abuse (Martin 2017).\nA large percentage of these children contribute to the refugee crisis in many developed countries. Children and young adults also make up more than 2% of all detected trafficking victims globally. In regions where the stats describing child abuse and neglect are high, there is an accompanying breakdown in the societal construct, law and order.\nThis has inspired many behavioral researchers to investigate how youthful/childhood experiences of abuse and neglect affect lifestyle at later stages of life. These forms of abuse and maltreatment have been implicated in the anti-social behaviors noticed in many individuals at a later stage of life (Herrenkohl et al. 2012)."

    "text": "Consequence of Abuse and Social Neglect in Children and Young Adults\n\nBehavioral Consequences\n\nThe behavioral consequences of child abuse and neglect are mostly observed as physical aggression and antisocial behavioral pattern. Children who were abuse at a tender age or subjected to different forms of torture and neglect are most likely to show higher forms of aggression in the society.\nResearchers have explained that this consequence of an initial abuse –experienced at younger age –is a manifestation of a learned response in the affected individuals. Adults who experienced neglect and abuse at a younger age are also most likely to exhibit fear, anger, withdrawal and avoidance (Lippard and Nemeroff 2020).\nThey also display unruly behavior and have high rates of conduct problems, interaction problems and substance use problems.\n\n\nPsychosocial Consequences\n\nSevere neglect at childhood have been shown to adversely affect psychosocial wellbeing at later stages of life. These psychosocial consequences have been observed to manifest as attention deficits, poor social skills, developmental delays, emotional delays and indulgence in illicit drug use.\nYoung adults experiencing psychosocial consequences earlier also shows indications of diminished self-esteem, deteriorating social functioning and a heightened level of depression (Masselink, Van Roekel, and Oldehinkel 2017). This explains why psychiatric diagnosis and affective disorders are common among young adults who fall in this category.\nSignificant emotional difficulties, inappropriate sexual behaviors, an affiliation to antisocial gangs are also widely documented among this population. There are also many forms of medical, physiological and cognitive consequences experienced at adulthood and linked with child abuse and neglect."

    "text": "Research Evidences Linking Child Abuse and Neglect with Substance Use Disorders at Adulthood\nYoung adults who experienced moderate and severe forms of abuse and neglect during childhood have long been considered a vulnerable population to alcohol problems and illicit drug use. However, until recently, these considerations were largely unproven. Currently, there are numerous scientific enquiries establishing a link between abuse and neglect at childhood and substance use disorders at late stages of adulthood.\nOne of the earliest studies on this relationship was published by Wilsnack and colleagues in 1997. The researchers assessed the relationship between child abuse and adult drinking behavior in 1,099 women participating in a 190-year national survey on women’s drinking.\nCases of abuse were reported retrospectively by the participants. The research results suggest that women who had experience forms if abuse and neglect during childhood were significantly likely to have alcohol-related behaviors and problems.\nIn 2013, the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs published a research conducted to examine possible links childhood maltreatment and alcohol use disorders. The participant poll was made of 4,468 people within the age range of 18-25, participating in the National Epidemiology Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.\nAfter adjusting sociodemographic characteristics, the authors concluded that childhood maltreatment was associated with greater likelihood of an alcohol use disorder. Most importantly, difference in age prevalence of alcohol use disorders among the participants who reported multiple types of maltreatment and physical abuse was significant in the older age groups.\nMany research studies have covered more than alcohol-related risky behaviors on this subject. A research report published by the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence examined how Substance misuse problems are exhibited as coping motive for childhood abuse in South African adolescents attending school.\nThis research was designed as a secondary analysis of 1,149 adolescents attending schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Childhood trauma, alcohol and drug problems and coping orientation were measured with Questionnaires.\nResearch results suggested that drug use –as a coping mechanism –mediates the relationship between three forms of child abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) and substance use problems in adolescents (Hogarth, Martin, and Seedat 2019).\nMany other researches have documented and established a link between reported cases of childhood abuse and substance use problems in later stages of life. The common theme in these researches indicates that childhood problems of abuse and neglect significantly predispose adults to substance use disorders.\nBy extension, it is safe to conclude that adults currently suffering from alcohol use disorders and illicit drug addiction might have a positive history of abuse and neglect."

    "text": "Risk Factors Influencing the Link Between Childhood Abuse and Substance Use Problems in Adulthood\nWhy exactly are substance use problems in adulthood the predominant social observation related to child abuse and neglect? This question has prompted various researchers to examine why these adults choose this response over others. The arguments explaining this observation so far are numerous.\nMany researchers agree that people who experienced neglect and forms of abuse as teenagers use alcohol and illicit drugs as a coping mechanism (Min et al. 2007). Repeated cases of childhood abuse and neglect leads to social withdrawal and depression. People who lack a proper coping mechanism engage in alcohol and drug abuse as a means to seek consolation.\nAlcohol and illicit drugs are not indicated for these social problems and as such, cannot solve them. These individuals simply engage in repeated use of these products, leading to dependence.\nAntisocial behaviors have long been linked with childhood cases of abuse and neglect. These behaviors, captured many times as aggression, violence, delinquency and hyperactivity, are widely considered as consequences of childhood victimization, abuse and neglect.\nOn reaching a stage of external socialization, people exhibiting these behaviors fits perfectly in a deviant group of others exhibiting same. These peer groups of delinquents hold oppositional and antisocial views that promotes alcohol and illicit drug use. The repeated circle of group influence leads to alcohol and illicit drug use and dependence among the individuals of these groups.\nPost-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in in victims of childhood abuse and neglect have also been described as an influencing factor for alcohol and drug dependence. There are many research reports suggesting that the prevalence of alcohol problems is likely higher in adults with a positive history of abuse and neglect and has experienced PTSD (Cross et al. 2015).\nThese researches implicates PTSD as factor that increases the incidence of substance misuse as coping mechanism for childhood experiences of abuse."

For many women, these changes mean a lot and influence the quality of life as menopause starts.\nMenopausal age vary significantly across a population. Many times, it depends on genetics, race, socioeconomic status, number of ovulations, age at menarche, environmental factors, exposure to chemicals and toxins, and the presence of any medical conditions affecting the reproductive system. These factors constitute huge differences and unpredictability in the menopausal experiences across populations (n.d.a)."

    "text": "The Physiology of Menopause\nPrimarily, menopause results from a complete loss of ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropin stimulations. These decreased sensitivities are directly involved in follicular attrition. The oocytes (the female gamete cells called ‘the egg’) in the ovaries undergo raid degeneration and eventual loss of reproductive ability (n.d.b).\nAs expected, the rapid degeneration of these oocytes results in a decline in the quantity and quality of ovarian follicles. So, when menopause happens, the reproductive system is healthy, but the follicles are shrinking and the reproductive ability is eventually lost. \nAs follicles age and shrink in size, resistance to gonadotropin reduces consistently, and the circulating levels of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) increase. The increased circulating levels prompt the stromal stimulation of the ovary, causing a decrease in estradiol levels, inhibin levels, and an increase in estrone levels (n.d.c).\nThe estradiol decrease is more dramatic as the decline rate climbs significantly within 4 years. As ovulation stops, the production from the conversion of androgens in the ovarian stroma and the production of estrogen in extra-gonadal sites remain unaffected. The adipose tissues, muscles, liver, bone, bone marrow, and hair roots represent a huge source of estrogen during this phase of a woman’s life.\nExposure to estrogen from non-ovarian sites also comes with its effects –it increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in menopausal women. The complete hormonal interplay during this stage of life is numerous and very complex to cover within the scope of this review."

    "text": "Thyroid Functions At Menopause\nNo doubt, menopause is a process of complex hormonal regulations. With every volume of gonadal hormones and other markers of reproductive function, a complex system of hormonal regulation explains the physiology of menopause.\nWomen spend one-third of their lifetime in menopause, combating the symptoms associated with this stage and its occasional fluctuations in hormonal levels. Therapy methods that explore balancing these hormones have long been proposed, modified, and practiced in human medicine. Hormone replacement therapy is commonly recommended in postmenopausal women.\nThe function of the thyroid hormone in menopause is an interesting topic in women’s health. Dysfunctions of the thyroid predominantly affect women with an incidence of 20 times greater than men. The incidence of these thyroid dysfunctions also increases with increasing age (n.d.d).\nSince the average age of menopause is pegged at 50, regular thyroid screenings are recommended for menopausal women. Clinical survey results showed that nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and thyroid gland autoimmunity are well reported in menopausal women.\nIt is sometimes difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disease in menopausal women as the symptoms for both cessation of ovulation (menopause) and thyroid dysfunctions in these women are common. Understanding how the thyroid affects hormonal regulation at menopause can help with therapy options for managing the symptoms a woman experiences at menopause."

    "text": "Researches Linking Thyroid Hormone Function and Menopause\nMany studies suggest that estrogen has a direct effect on the human thyroid cells. These interactions are studied extensively during menopause as the thyroid also ages. Earlier reports on this interaction have shown how estrogen increases the thyroxine-binding globulin and how thyroid hormone is needed in hypothyroid women undergoing estrogen therapy (n.d.e).\nThe molecular interaction between estrogen and thyroid hormones is mediated by the estrogen receptors. In the body, the cellular action of estrogen –a lipophilic molecule, is medicated by its binding with two nuclear receptors –estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, and ER-beta. In any cells where these receptors are found, estrogen can affect a cellular change with receptor to receptor binding. This is how the estrogen-thyroid hormone relationship works during menopause (n.d.f).\nEstrogen receptors (ERs) have been described in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic human thyroid tissues. However, these studies are relatively new, and their evidence is still under investigation. Some chemical assay studies have discovered ER-positivity in both normal and abnormal thyroid tissues.\nToday, both estrogen receptor variants have been reportedly discovered in thyroid tissues with many researchers currently examining how these receptors mediate thyroid functions during menopause. For now, the working assumption is that estrogen binding to ER-alpha promotes cell proliferation and growth while estrogen binding to ER-beta promotes apoptotic actions.\nThyroid hormone dysfunctions are especially frequent in postmenopausal women. With these dysfunctions come different signs and symptoms that make menopause a terrible experience for some women. These undesired symptoms have been linked to an aging thyroid function (n.d.g).\nAs women age, thyroid functioning declines Morphological studies have revealed that the thyroid epithelium degenerates, leading to its flattening and a resultant reduction in the size of the thyroid follicles. In many women, fibrous connective tissues and lymphoid tissues may replace a part of the previously healthy thyroid gland.\nThe ability of the thyroid gland to uptake dietary iodine and produce its hormones during this period diminishes. The statistics are worrying. The iodine-uptake ability of the thyroid in people over 80 years old becomes 40 percent lower than in people over 30 years. The daily production of T4 –the main thyroid gland also decreases per microgram with biological metabolism slowing down significantly (n.d.h).   \nAs menopause progresses, the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction increases in women. An early study –the Whickham Survey, provided statistical justification for this. This study discovered that the incidence of elevated Thyroid-stimulating hormone is about 7.6% in the general female population and 17% in women over 70 years of age.\nThe risk for developing hypothyroidism in women 75 -80 years of age is pegged at 14/1000/year. In another study –the Colorado Survey, the incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to be about 4 percent in women aged 25 years. This value rises to about 14 and 20 percent for women aged 55 and 75 respectively (n.d.i).\nThis study further establishes the point that thyroid hormone functioning is very important in menopause. If the thyroid dysfunctional during this period, the signs and symptoms that follow can make menopause a terrible experience for any woman out there."

    "text": "Navigating Menopause\nGlobally, about 1.5 million women experience the transition to menopause every year. Many of these women often report cases of undesired symptoms including vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, insomnia, and joint pain. If not properly managed, these symptoms can make menopause a very terrible experience. The most commonly reported symptoms of menopause include:\n\n\nVasomotor Symptoms\n\nVasomotor symptoms during menopause are often reported as hot flashes. About 85% of menopausal women report hot flashes of variable severity, frequency, and duration. Hot flashes can also be present in about 55% of women at the perimenopause stage (n.d.j).\nThere are some racial and ethnic variations to this experience as Caucasian women reported the highest prevalence and Japanese and Chinese women reports the lowest. It is a feeling of intense warmth presenting with sweating, flushing, and chills. The physiological events that occur during hot flashes have been linked with different biological responses to hormonal fluctuations at menopause.\nThese includes elevated skin blood flow –suggesting peripheral vasodilation with temperature spikes occurring in the digits, face, arm, back, legs, chest, and abdomen. Measures of sweating and skin conductance also increase during these episodes.\nMost importantly, core body temperature increases before hot flashes. The increase in core body temperature is caused by increased metabolic rate and the peripheral vasodilation that follows. Many studies have also related the cause of hot flashes to variabilities in the levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid hormones in menopausal women.\nRegardless of the contributing mechanisms, it is evident that both hormone therapy and non-hormonal therapy can help relieve hot flashes in these women.\n\n\nVulvovaginal Atrophy\n\nVulvovaginal atrophy presents as vaginal dryness, dysuria, urinary urgency, and dyspareunia. The physiology of urogenital atrophy in menopausal women has long been described. The fluctuations in estrogen levels during perimenopause and the sustained low levels of this hormone during menopause render the reproductive tissues fragile (n.d.k).\nhe fragile tissues are distressed, leading to the multiple vulvovaginal symptoms experienced at menopause. In addition to tissue distress, there can be vaginal atrophy, narrowing, and shortening of the vagina, and uterine prolapse. The urinary tracts have estrogen receptors, and as the fluctuations in estrogen levels continue the risk of urinary tract infections increases.\nUnlike hot flashes, the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy do not improve over time without treatment.\n\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nAs aging progresses, sleep quality generally deteriorates. With menopause, the decrease in sleep quality becomes more noticeable. A 2015 study published by Menopause evaluated the patterns in actigraphy-defined sleep measures of sleep and movements across the menstrual cycle in midlife menstruating women. Results from this study suggest that women report trouble sleeping during peri-menopause and sleep quality worsens at menopause (n.d.l).\nStudies have also suggested that as much as 25 minutes of quality sleep per night can be lost by women during their late reproductive years. Compromise in sleep quality at menopause has been linked with hormonal changes.\nMany times, the sleep disorders reported by menopausal women can be hard to categorize. These sleep difficulties are often complicated by mood disorders associated with menopause and poor sleep hygiene habits. It is common for these women to report nighttime awakenings, night sweats, and short sleep duration.\nThey may also experience difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep and early awakenings.  Insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome are the commonly identified sleep disorders in menopausal women. The clinical burden of menopause-induced sleep disorders can be very huge. These women experience daytime fatigue, sleepiness, generalized body weakness, and restlessness.\n\n\nDepression and Adverse Mood\n\nHormonal fluctuation during menopause has a bearing on mood. In its 157th annual general meeting, the American Psychiatric Association delivered an update on the risk factors and treatment approaches for perimenopause-related mood disturbances. This update suggested that an estimated 20% of women transitioning to menopause have depression at some point (n.d.m).\nClinical studies have suggested that mood disorders are more noticeable at menopause and less during postmenopausal years. Menopausal-related depression is caused by fluctuations and a reduction in estrogen levels. Estrogen and steroid hormones are known to stimulate the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.\nEstrogen also increases the effects of serotonin and norepinephrine –hormones considered to be involved in the physiology of depression. The strongest risk factor of depression in these menopausal women is a prior history of depression, with consistent variabilities in the levels of reproductive and menopause regulatory hormones (n.d.n).\nOther risk factors identified so far include poor sleep, high body mass index, low socioeconomic class, and race. Other menopausal symptoms commonly reported include osteoporosis and changes in cognitive function."

    "text": "Correcting Menopausal Symptoms with an Optimized Thyroid\nMay women would choose to bypass the undesired symptoms of menopause if they could. In addition to reducing life quality during menopause, these menopausal symptoms make menopause a terrible experience for many women. Treating these symptoms is a big topic in human medicine. Hormone replacement therapy has long been used in reducing the effects of these symptoms.\nHowever, there have been many controversies surrounding this therapy option. Except that it is contraindicated in many women, there are also many studies linking it with cancer, stroke, cognitive decline, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular diseases.\nOptimizing the thyroid and another hormonal complex regulating the events at menopause has been proposed as a viable approach to managing these symptoms. Supplying the body with enough dietary iodine is a cheap and clinically friendly way of optimizing thyroid health. On average, the Recommended Daily Allowance of iodine for menopausal women is 150 micrograms per day (n.d.o).\nThis micronutrient is primarily needed by the thyroid gland for the production of thyroid hormones. Menopausal syndromes have been linked with thyroid dysfunctions and a decline in thyroid hormone levels. Improving thyroid functioning with iodine supplements can help manage these symptoms better in women.\nSeafood is the largest reservoir of dietary iodine on earth. Consuming seafood can give the body a moderate quantity of iodine for optimizing thyroid health (n.d.p). Menopausal women who are vegans or do not use iodized salts are at a greater risk of these symptoms. Vegans’ meals contain no iodine, making it hard for menopausal women who are vegans to have a healthy thyroid as they age.\nMany women may also choose to get their daily iodine portions to form iodine supplements. Iodine products formulated for menopausal women supply 12.5mg of iodine to the body. At this quantity, the recommended daily iodine intake requirements are met and the thyroid gland has a good reservoir of dietary iodine."

    "text": "Bottom Line\nMenopause is an important part of a woman’s reproductive life. On average, it takes up about one-third of a woman’s lifetime. The menopausal transition is characterized by fluctuations in the levels of reproductive hormone and other regulatory hormones n the body.\nThese hormonal variations affect the physiology of menopausal women, causing different symptoms that makes menopause a terrible experience for many. Optimizing the thyroid gland by supplying the body with adequate dietary iodine can help reduce the severity and frequency of these symptoms."

    "text": "The medicinal benefits of cannabis and cannabis-derived products have been known for years. At a time when no sufficient scientific evidence exists for its use, cannabis was used as self-prescribed natural products for the treatment of pain, dementia, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders(Wang et al. 2023).\nWith time, reports of debilitating adverse effects including addiction, psychosis and cognitive impairment in known long-term users emerged. As natural product science evolved, researchers extracted and studied the component compounds of the cannabis plant.\nThese researches concluded that cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid showing potential therapeutic benefits in animal models and human test subjects. As expected, the focus of enquiry on the Cannabis sativa plant shifted towards cannabidiol (Sholler, Schoene, and Spindle 2020).\nIntegrated healthcare providers reported some impressive reports on the pharmacological benefits of CBD and advised that this compound be integrated into modern medicine. Today, the term ‘Medical cannabis’ in a large part refers to cannabidiol.\nAt first, CBD was only allowed for use as an adjunctive treatment in the management of rare and chronic conditions with no standard therapy plan exists. Clinical trials were also conducted to further understand the pharmacology of this compound.\nOn June 25, 2018, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered the available clinical trial results available for Epidiolex and subsequently approved an oral solution of the drug. Epidiolex was approved for the treatment of seizures associated Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet Syndrome (Corroon and Kight 2018).\nEpidiolex became the first FDA-approved cannabidiol-based drug for use in adults and children older than 2 years. As expected, many independent research enquiries were conducted to ascertain the efficacy and safety of the new drug in the target population. Since its approval, Epidolex has shown impressive results in the treatment of the two rare forms of epilepsy for which it was indicated (Abu-Sawwa, Scutt, and Park 2020).\nTo a large extent, the approval of Epidiolex started the much publicized green rush and also created positive promotional headlines for cannabis and cannabis-derived products. For the first time, modern medicine turned to a cannabis-derived product for succor and considered other cannabis-derived products as a potential game changer in human medicine."

One of the first noticeable impact is the sudden increases in the total market share of the CBD industry.\nBefore 2017, only a few market research reports on the valuation of the global cannabidiol market existed. However, by 2018, Epidiolex’s approval prompted different market analysts to monitor the market of this new drug.\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cannabidiol market was valued at $4.6 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.2% from 2019 to 2025."

In the first quarter of 2020, Epidiolex sales in the United States alone was valued at $106.1 million. During this period, Epidiolex sales in Germany and U.K totaled $10 million.\n\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals has also completed plans to introduce the CBD-based drug to Sweden and Italy after a successful entry into France. Despite the Coronavirus pandemic, the global sale of Epidiolex kept increasing.\nGW Pharmaceuticals has also filed a supplemental New Drug Application with the FDA in a bid to secure approval for Epidiolex in the treatment of seizures with tuberous sclerosis complex. As an expected ripple effect, Epidiolex has spiked investment interests in other cannabis stocks globally (Thiele et al. 2021)."
