Cannabidiol has rapidly been gaining global attention, so we are sure you must have heard something about it. In the last decade, the public perception about cannabidiol and cannabidiol-containing products has changed significantly. This change is reflected in many pro-cannabis regulations that are currently active in many countries around the world. These regulations have positively impacted the global cannabis market, improving its valuation from \$10.6 billion in 2018 to a projected valuation of over \$63 billion by 2024 (Statista, 2019). Over the next 3 years or so, the cannabis industry is expected to see vast increases in cultivation, distribution, and its customer base.

## Cannabidiol

Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid produced by Cannabis sativa (Indian Hemp) --an herbaceous plant native to Central and Western Asia. In the United Sates and many other pro-cannabis countries today, hemp - an industrial variation of cannabis sativa containing less than .3% THC, is the only legal source of cannabidiol. For many centuries, there have been different claims about the medical benefits of CBD derived from hemp. However, these claims remained largely unverified until the early 1970s. During this period, animal tests and a few human studies on the bioactivity of cannabinoids were conducted.

Evidence from these studies make it easy to better understand how CBD and CBD-derived compounds can be beneficial in human medicine. Recent clinical studies have provided convincing evidence supporting the anxiolytic, analgesic, antipsychotic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties of CBD (Davies et al., 2019).

You might have heard about the CBD wonder drug 'Epidiolex.' In June 2018, the Food Drug Administration approved Epidiolex as the first CBD-based drug for the management of rare, severe epilepsy (Sekar., 2019). With one FDA approved CBD drug being approved by the FDA on the market, you can assume that the volume of research currently dedicated to developing new CBD products for use in humans is high -- which it is. Studies on CBD have gone up drastically in the last few years since it was legalized in the US.

## CBD Hemp Flower

The Cannabis sativa plant is a dynamic plant with many useful parts. You can say every part of the cannabis plant serves a purpose and are sold for different value on the cannabis market. CBD hemp flower is on of the most sought after cannabis products. It is described the dried or raw hemp flower buds of the cannabis plant, containing less than 0.3 percent THC. CBD hemp flower can be sold under different names, including cannabis flower, hemp flower, CBG flower, and CBD flower.

In some countries, cannabis products with THC levels below 0.3 percent THC are classified as legal marijuana. CBD hemp flower contains no significant amounts of calories, fat cholesterol, lactose, and trans fat. Depending on the strain, hemp flowers can bloom and store variable quantities of secondary cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes. The flavonoid content of the hemp flower imparts the potent flavors and smell of the flower. Secondary cannabinoids are those cannabadinoid that are not THC or CBD in the cannabis sativa plant. Flavonoids and are contents of the hemp flower that imparts the vaious flavours and scents in the cannabis strains. Terpenes on the other hands, serves multiple multiple purposes --they imparts on flavor and complements the bioactivity of the principal cannabinoids in humans.

In the US, thanks to the Hemp Farm Bill of 2018, CBD derived from hemp plants that contains less than .3% thc, is legal and able to be sold in all 50 states. Depending on where you are located or where you are buying your hemp flower from, you can run into many different names for it: cbd hemp flower, cbd flower, cbg flower, hemp buds, and hemp cbd flower. Hemp flower is produced by cultivating the feminized hemp flower seeds in a greenhouse, indoor, or oudoor agriculture growing operation. Just like marijuana, hemp flower has many different strains, and each strain has a different compostion of the cannaboids, flavonoids, and terpenes.

An important feature of hemp flower you should never miss is its unique composition. You might have purchased a few cannabis products from the market and notice that some of these products are marked 'full-spectrum cannabis products.' As full-spectrum products, they are formulated from the cannabis plant and include compounds from the whole hemp plant. In essence, these products were not simply isolated cannabis compounds. Hemp flowers fall in this category. Depending on the cannabis strain, it contains a residual, THC, terpenes, and other phytocannabinoids that make using hemp flower instead of pure CBD an experience to relish.

### Differenciating Between CBD and Hemp Flower

Recently, the global cannabis consumer market noticed steady upticks in demand for CBD hemp flower. These demands were reasonably fueled by increased pro-cannabis regulations and the increased research reports on CBD hemp flower. Cannabis users simply desired to test this new method of consuming their favorite weed strain. As it stands, the demand for cannabis hemp flower is predicted to remain high, contributing to the projected market valuation of the global cannabis market in 2024 (Grand View Research, 2021).

Scientific inquiries into the properties of hemp flowers have also created new answers for cannabis enthusiasts about hemp flowers. However, these researches have also directly increased the public awareness of the medical and recreational benefits. So, how do you better understand what hemp flowers offer? What, if any, are the main differences between CBD hemp flower and CBG hemp flower? These questions should enlarge your horizon about the endless usage benefits of cannabis hemp flower also make you appreciate the mother plant better. The most widely researched and documented differences between CBD and CBG hemp flower include:

##### 1. Visual Features

This is perhaps the first difference you would notice between two cannabis products labeled as 'CBD hemp flower' and 'CBG hemp flower.' The visual features of the CBD hemp flower depend much on the strain from which it is derived. So, the appearance of the buds might be different across strains. CBG hemp flower, on the other hand, has more delicate trichomes than CBD hemp flower. Cannabis farmers take extra precautions during harvesting and curing to ensure that these trichomes are preserved in their original state.

##### 2. Phytocannabinoid Composition

Cannabis sativa contains over 400 phytocannabinoids present in pure and bounds forms with other compounds. These compounds are either singly or jointly responsible for the bioactive properties of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. These compounds are present in different quantities in different extracts and derivatives of the parent plant. Phytochemical distribution on a growing cannabis plant varies extensively (Andre et al., 2016). The hemp stem, leaf, bud, and trichomes have different phytocannabinoid distribution.

CBD hemp flower and CBG hemp flower are different primarily in their dominant cannabinoid composition. CBG is directly derived from CBGA -- a carboxylic acid that can form other cannabinoids. CBG flowers are derived from cannabis strains that are high in CBG. This makes CBG (Carbigerol) the dominant cannabinoid in the CBG hemp flower. In CBD hemp flower, however, cannabidiol (CBD) is the dominant cannabinoid.

##### 3. Slightly different Bioactivity

CBD has been around for many years. Unlike CBD hemp flower, the focus on CBG hemp flower started a few years ago. These hemp types may have slightly different effects on cannabis users. Many reports are suggesting that CBG hemp provides a more energizing effect than CBD hemp flower. CBG hemp flower is also recommended as adjunct treatment of bacterial infections (Giovanni., 2008). However, the effects of CBG hemp flower in humans are not as pronounced and steady as with CBD hemp flower. The availability of each type of hemp flower is another primary difference between these products.

## Medical Benefits of CBD Hemp Flower

The research evidence supporting the medical and recreational use of CBD hemp flower keeps increasing by the day. Medical inquiries into the cannabis plants are aimed at better understanding the pharmacology of cannabinoids and how they affect human physiology. Most of these studies examined the mechanism of interaction between the biological system in humans and the cannabinoids of the cannabis plant. Do you know the body has its system of circulating 'natural cannabinoids'? These chemicals are called endocannabinoids.

## Claims

Unlike in the early days of unverified claims about the benefits of CBD and other cannabinoids, we now have pharmacological explanations for the effects of these compounds in biological systems

## How Cannabinoids Interact with the Human Body

Cannabinoids of the cannabis plant interact with the body by mimicking the effects of the endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are structurally complex biological compounds made of amides, esters, and other derivatives of long-chain polyunsaturated compounds. Produced on-demand from lipid constituents of the body cells, these compounds act as biological mediators in cell signaling processes (Zou., 2018). They are relatively unstable and sometimes produce no significant systemic action. Endocannabinoids and the enzymes responsible for their production and deactivation make up a complex biological network of the Endocannabinoid System (ECS).

The cannabinoid receptors provide a biological action point for the endocannabinoids on numerous target organs where they are present. Cannabinoids, including CBD and THC, act on these receptors to effect a biological action. This is why your favorite cannabis strains give you the euphoria, calms, and other recreational benefits you enjoy.

## Takeaway: Considering Buying CBD Hemp Flower?

##### 1.  CBD Hemp Flower Gives You Flexibility and Variety in Cannabis Usage

This is perhaps the single most important reason you should consider switching to CBD hemp flower. Presenting cannabis as the hemp flower helps you creatively use the plant. Hemp flowers can be smoked like tobacco or incorporated into food products. The latter method of usage is the branding idea behind a new line of cannabis products --cannabis edibles. The dried hemp flower can be hand-rolled and smoked like a regular cannabis joint. When incorporated into food, the buds are mixed into a recipe, then cooked or baked.

CBD, like THC and other phytochemicals present in the CBD hemp flowers, are soluble in fat. Infusing these products into oil or butter is a recommended method of consuming cannabis as a food.

##### 2.  CBD Hemp Flower Gives the Entourage Effect

Cannabis users provide feedbacks describing the effects of many strains. This feedbacks help botanists and cannabis researchers to better understand and classify the different cannabis strains available today. Anecdotal reports from different users suggest that the 'full spectrum' cannabis products, by an unknown mechanism, exert a better therapeutic effect in humans compared to isolated CBD. David Mechoulam --the famous father of cannabis research, proceeded to investigate this claim and discovered the 'Entourage Effect.' The effect is a proposed mechanism explaining how THC acts in synergism with other components of the cannabis plant to modulate the biochemical effects of cannabis in humans.

In 2011, the British Journal of Pharmacology published the report of a study confirming that selective breeding of cannabis chemotypes rich in phytocannabinoids offer complementary effects that strengthen the therapeutic properties of cannabis extracts (Russo., 2011). This report confirmed the entourage effect earlier described by Mechoulam. Unlike pure CBD isolates, CBD hemp flower contains a trace amount of these phytocannabinoids. The medical and recreational benefits of using CBD hemp flower are pronounced compared with pure CBD isolates.
