::: {#hero-heading}
Since completing my first degree in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, I have expanded my reach beyond primary healthcare by learning technical skills exploring the intersection of finance, healthcare and data science.

Currently, I develop **medical communication solutions** in pharma, medicine and professional learning with deliverables designed as continuing education courses, website copies and patients education pamphlets.

When I am not writing healthcare contents, you'd find me on **RStudio,** **Microsoft Excel** or **pgAdmin** writing code required for exploratory data analysis, inferential statistics, and data modelling in **R**, **SQL** and **DAX**.

Other times, you will probably find me somewhere in Lagos, Nigeria, discussing politics or listening to a weird mashed-up playlist of Billie Eilish, Jacob Banks, Lana Del Rey, Burna Boy, and the Nigerian sonic-artistry maestro, Brymo Olooforo.

Oh, I almost forgot! I am a big fan of film scores composed by Hans Zimmer and Ramin Djawadi.
