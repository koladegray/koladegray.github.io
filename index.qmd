::: {#hero-heading}
Since completing my first degree in Pharmacy from Nigeria's Premier varsity, *University of Ibadan*, my research has appeared in the *BMJC* and on med. writing spaces as journal reviews, gap analysis, medical commentaries and continuing educations courses. Currently, I develop **medical communication solutions** in pharma, neurology, infections diseases and professional learning with deliverables designed as continuing education courses, website copies, .....

When I am not writing healthcare contents, you'd find me on **RStudio,** **Microsoft Excel** or **pgAdmin** writing code syntaxes required for exploratory data analysis, inferential statistics, data modelling and data validation in **R**, **SQL** and **DAX**.

Other times, you would probably find me somewhere in Lagos, Nigeria, discussing politics in Africa or listening to a wierd mashed-up playlist of Billie Eilish, Jacob Banks, Lana Del Rey, Burna Boy, and the Nigerian sonic-artistry maestro, Brymo Olooforo.
