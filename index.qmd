::: {#hero-heading}
Since completing my first degree in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, I have expanded my reach beyond primary healthcare, learning technical skills directly exploring the intersection of Commercial Strategy, Analytics and Healthcare.


As a side quest, I develop **medical communications** in the Human Sciences with deliverables designed as Science Blogs, White Papers, CMEs, Publications and Medical Briefs.

Over the past five years, I have provided freelance and ghostwriting services for Fortune 500s in Diagnostics, Nutrition, Oncology, Sports Medicine and Cannabis Marketing â€”save to say I have worked for the big guns and the small revolvers ðŸ˜‰

When I am not actively writing science, you'd find me on **RStudio,** **Microsoft Excel** or **pgAdmin** developing code workflows for Market research, Data Analysis, Inferential Statistics and Insight Reporting with **R Programming**, **SQL** and **DAX**.

Other times, you might find me somewhere in Lagos, Nigeria, discussing politics, bing-watching **The Voice**, or listening to a mixed playlist of my music faves: Akon, Billie Eilish, Jacob Banks, Lana Del Rey, Burna Boy, and the Nigerian sonic-artistry maestro, Brymo Olooforo. You know what? Add Sia somewhere in that list.

I am also a big fan of film scores composed by Hans Zimmer and Ramin Djawadi.
